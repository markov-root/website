This is more of a gap due to how nascent the field of evaluations is, rather than a limitation of evaluations themselves. As AI systems increasingly incorporate multiple modalities like text, images, audio, and video, our evaluation methods struggle to keep pace. Most current evaluation frameworks focus primarily on text-based outputs, leaving significant gaps in our ability to assess risks and capabilities across other modalities. This limitation becomes particularly problematic as models are built to generate and manipulate multi-modal content. A model might appear safe when evaluated purely on its text generation, but could pose unexpected risks through its ability to generate or manipulate images or videos. The interaction between different modalities creates new vectors for potential harm that our current evaluation methods might miss entirely. This also yet again adds another layer to the curse of dimensionality and expands the task space of model evaluations.

Current legislative and regulatory efforts around AI safety are severely hampered by the lack of robust, standardized evaluation methods. Consider the recent executive orders and proposed regulations requiring safety assessments of AI systems - how can governments enforce these requirements when we lack reliable ways to measure what makes an AI system "safe"? This creates a circular problem: regulators need evaluation standards to create effective policies, but the development of these standards is partly driven by regulatory requirements. The U.S. government\'s recent initiative to have various agencies evaluate AI capabilities in cybersecurity and biosecurity highlights this challenge. These agencies, despite their expertise in their respective domains, often lack the specialized knowledge needed to evaluate advanced AI systems comprehensively.
