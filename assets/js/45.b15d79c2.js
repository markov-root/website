It employs a proof-of-work consensus mechanism called RandomX, which is ASIC-resistant and designed to be more egalitarian for CPU miners.\nPrivacy Features:\na) Ring Signatures: These allow a sender to hide their transaction among a group of others, making it unclear which funds were actually spent.\nb) Stealth Addresses: One-time addresses are generated for each transaction, preventing public association of multiple transactions with a single wallet.\nc) RingCT (Ring Confidential Transactions): This feature hides the amount of XMR being transferred.\nd) Kovri: An in-development feature to route transactions through I2P nodes, hiding a user\'s IP address.\nFungibility:\nUnlike Bitcoin, where coins can be traced and potentially "tainted" by their history, all Monero coins are functionally identical and interchangeable. This makes Monero truly fungible.\nMining:\nMonero uses the RandomX algorithm, which is designed to be ASIC-resistant and favors CPU mining. This aims to keep mining decentralized and accessible to individual users.\nDynamic Block Size:\nMonero can automatically adjust its block size based on transaction volume, helping to prevent network congestion.\nRegular Protocol Upgrades:\nThe Monero community regularly implements hard forks to upgrade the protocol, usually twice a year. These upgrades often include security improvements and new features.\nEconomic Model:\nMonero has a slightly inflationary model. After the initial supply is mined, there will be a permanent fixed subsidy of 0.6 XMR per block to incentivize miners.\n'),e._v('\nThe "privacy by default" concept in Monero:')]),e._v(" "),t("ol",[t("li",[t("p",[e._v('Universal application: These privacy features are applied to all transactions on the Monero network.
