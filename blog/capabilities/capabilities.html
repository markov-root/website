We aim to acquaint readers with the latest breakthroughs across various domains such as language processing, vision, and robotics.</p> <p>Foundation Models: The second section focuses on foundation models, the paradigm powering the state-of-the-art systems introduced in the previous section. We explain the key techniques underpinning the huge success of these models such as self-supervised learning, zero-shot learning, and fine-tuning. The section concludes by looking at the risks that the foundation model paradigm could pose such as power centralization, homogenization, and the potential for emergent capabilities.</p> <p>Terminology: Before diving deeper, we establish the definitions that this book will be working with. This section explains why &quot;capabilities&quot; rather than &quot;intelligence&quot; is a more pragmatic measure for discussing AI risks. We also delineate key terms within the AI debate, such as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), and Transformative AI (TAI). The section concludes by introducing the (t,n)-AGI framework which allows us to more concretely measure the level of AI capabilities on a continuous scale, rather than having to rely on discrete thresholds.</p> <p>Leveraging Computation: In this section, we explore the importance of computation in AI's progress introducing the three main variables that govern the capabilities of today's foundation models - compute, data and parameter count. We explore scaling laws and hypotheses that predict the future capabilities of AI based on current scaling trends of these variables, offering insights into the computational strategies that could pave the way to AGI.</p> <p>Forecasting: Finally, the chapter addresses the challenge of forecasting AI's future, using biological anchors as a method to estimate the computational needs for transformative AI. This section sets the groundwork for discussing AI takeoff dynamics, including speed, polarity, and homogeneity, offering a comprehensive view of potential futures shaped by AI development.</p> <h1 id="state-of-the-art-ai"><a href="#state-of-the-art-ai" class="header-anchor">#</a> State-of-the-Art AI</h1> <p>Over the last decade, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced a profound transformation, largely attributed to the successes in deep learning. This remarkable progress has redefined the boundaries of AI capabilities, challenging many preconceived notions of what machines can achieve. The following sections detail some of these advancements.</p> <p><img src="Images/V7p_Image_1.jpeg" alt="Enter image alt description"></p> <p><em><strong>Figure</strong></em>*😗* Once a benchmark is published, it takes less and less time to solve it. This can illustrate the accelerating progress in AI and how quickly AI benchmarks are “saturating”, and starting to surpass human performance on a variety of tasks.

Early language models in 2018 struggled to construct coherent sentences. The evolution from these to the advanced capabilities of GPT-3 (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) and ChatGPT within less than 5 years is remarkable. These models demonstrate not only an improved capacity for generating text but also for responding to complex queries with nuanced, common-sense reasoning. Their performance in various question-answering tasks, including those requiring strategic thinking, has been particularly impressive.</p> <p>**GPT-4. **One of the state-of-the-art language models in 2024 is OpenAI’s LLM GPT-4. In contrast with the text-only GPT-3 and follow-ups, GPT-4 is multimodal: it was trained on both text and images. This means that it can now not only generate text based on images but has also gained some other capabilities. GPT-4 saw an upgraded context window with up to 32k tokens (tokens ≈ words). The short-term memory limit of an LLM can be thought of as the model's ability to retain information from previous tokens within a certain context window. GPT-4 is trained via next-token prediction (autoregressive self-supervised learning). In 2018 GPT-1 was barely able to count to 10, while in 2024 GPT-4 can implement complex programmatic functions among other things.</p> <p><img src="Images/CAe_Image_2.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></p> <p><em><strong>Figure</strong></em>*: a list of &quot;Nowhere near solved” [...] issues in AI, from &quot;A brief history of AI&quot;, published in January 2021 (<strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Artificial-Intelligence-Where/dp/1250770742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></strong>).

Remarkably, GPT-4 is trained using roughly the same methods as GPT-1, 2, and 3. The only significant difference is the size of the model and the data given to it during training. The size of the model has gone from 1.5B parameters to hundreds of billions of parameters, and datasets have become similarly larger and more diverse.</p> <p><img src="Images/uW1_Image_3.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></p> <p><em><strong>Figure</strong></em>*: How fast is AI Improving?

Frontier models represent the cutting edge of AI capabilities - they are the most advanced models in their respective domains. While many frontier models are also foundation models (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet), this isn't always the case. For example, AlphaFold, while being a frontier model in protein structure prediction, isn't typically considered a foundation model because it's specialized for a single task rather than serving as a general foundation for multiple applications (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34265844/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jumper et al., 2021<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). This distinction becomes particularly important because most AI safety research and regulation frameworks focus on frontier models due to their advanced capabilities. When discussions about AI safety reference &quot;foundation models,&quot; they're typically referring specifically to frontier foundation models - those foundation models that also represent the current state-of-the-art in capabilities. Understanding this distinction helps us better target and implement safety measures where they're most critically needed.</p> <h2 id="training"><a href="#training" class="header-anchor">#</a> Training</h2> <p><strong>How are foundation models trained differently from traditional AI systems?</strong> One key innovation of foundation models is their training paradigm. Generally, foundation models use a two-stage training process. First, they go through what we call a pre-training, and then second, they can be adapted through various mechanisms like fine-tuning or scaffolding to perform specific tasks. Rather than learning from human-labeled examples for specific tasks, these models learn by finding patterns in huge amounts of unlabeled data. This shift toward self-supervised learning on massive datasets fundamentally changes not just how models learn, but also what kinds of capabilities and risks might emerge (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bommasani et al., 2022<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).

During this phase, the model isn't trained for any specific task - instead, it develops broad capabilities that can later be specialized. This generality is both powerful and concerning from a safety perspective. While it enables the model to adapt to many different tasks, it also means we can't easily predict or constrain what the model might learn to do (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13916" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hendrycks et al., 2022<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).</p> <p><strong>How does self-supervised learning enable pre-training?</strong> Self-supervised learning (SSL) is the key technical innovation that makes foundation models possible. This is how we actually implement the pre-training phase. Unlike traditional supervised learning, which requires human-labeled data, SSL leverages the inherent structure of the data itself to create training signals. For example, instead of manually labeling images, we might just hide part of a full image we already have and ask a model to predict what the rest should be. So it might predict the bottom half of an image given the top half, learning about which objects often appear together. As an example, it might learn that images with trees and grass at the top often have more grass, or maybe a path, at the bottom. It learns about objects and their context — trees and grass often appear in parks, dogs are often found in these environments, paths are usually horizontal, and so on. These learned representations can then be used for a wide variety of tasks that the model was not explicitly trained for, like identifying dogs in images, or recognizing parks - all without any human-provided labels! The same concept applies in language, a model might predict the next word in a sentence, such as &quot;The cat sat on the ____,&quot; learning grammar, syntax, and context as long as we repeat this over huge amounts of text.</p> <p><strong>What is fine-tuning</strong>**?** After pre-training, foundation models can be adapted through two main approaches: fine-tuning and prompting. Fine-tuning involves additional training on a specific task or dataset to specialize the model's capabilities. For example, we might use Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to make language models better at following instructions or being more helpful. Prompting, on the other hand, involves providing the model with carefully crafted inputs that guide it toward desired behaviors without additional training. We'll discuss these adaptation methods in more detail in Chapter 8 when we explore scalable oversight.</p> <p><strong>Why does this training process matter for AI safety?</strong> The training process of foundation models creates several unique safety challenges. First, the self-supervised nature of pre-training means we have limited control over what the model learns - it might develop unintended capabilities or behaviors. Second, the adaptation process needs to reliably preserve any safety properties we've established during pre-training. Finally, the massive scale of training data and compute makes it difficult to thoroughly understand or audit what the model has learned. Many of the safety challenges we'll discuss throughout this book - from goal misgeneralization to scalable oversight - are deeply connected to how these models are trained and adapted.</p> <h2 id="properties"><a href="#properties" class="header-anchor">#</a> Properties</h2> <p><strong>Why do we need to understand the properties of foundation models?</strong> Besides just understanding the training process, we also need to understand the key defining characteristics or the abilities of these models. These properties often determine both the capabilities and potential risks of these systems. They help explain why foundation models pose unique safety challenges compared to traditional AI systems. Their ability to transfer knowledge, generalize across many different domains, and develop emergent capabilities means we can't rely on traditional safety approaches that assume narrow, predictable behavior.</p> <p><strong>What is transfer learning?</strong> Transfer learning is one of the most fundamental properties of foundation models - their ability to transfer knowledge learned during pre-training to new tasks and domains. Rather than starting from scratch for each task, we can leverage the general knowledge these models have already acquired (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bommasani et al., 2022<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). This property enables rapid adaptation and deployment, it also means that both capabilities and safety risks can transfer in unexpected ways. For instance, a model might transfer not just useful knowledge but also harmful biases or undesired behaviors to new applications.</p> <p><strong>What are zero-shot and few-shot learning?</strong> The ability to perform new tasks with very few examples, or even no examples at all. For example, GPT-4 can solve novel reasoning problems just from a natural language description of the task (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI, 2023<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). This emergent ability to generalize to new situations is powerful but concerning from a safety perspective. If models can adapt to novel situations in unexpected ways, it becomes harder to predict and control their behavior in deployment.</p> <p><strong>Why is generality?</strong> Generalization in foundation models works differently from traditional AI systems. Rather than just generalizing within a narrow domain, these models can generalize capabilities across domains in surprising ways.

First, once trained, their internal representations and behaviors are extremely difficult to modify in targeted ways. Unlike traditional software where we can directly edit specific functions, changing one behavior in a foundation model risks unpredictable effects on other capabilities. Second, when these models are deployed across many applications, maintaining control becomes a distributed systems problem. Safety failures can propagate through multiple systems before they're detected. Third, their black-box nature makes it extremely difficult to understand why they make specific decisions or how they might behave in novel situations - a challenge we'll explore deeply in our chapter on interpretability.</p> <p><strong>How do resource requirements limit development and access?</strong> Training foundation models requires massive computational resources, creating a delicate balance between cost and accessibility. While adapting an existing model might be relatively affordable, the substantial initial training costs risk centralizing power among a few well-resourced entities. This concentration of power raises important questions about oversight and responsible development, that we'll address in our chapter on governance. For example, a single training run of GPT-4 sized models can cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, effectively limiting who can participate in their development. Continued scaling has also brought up many concerns around the environmental impact of AI training runs.

Without a clear definition, how are we supposed to assess such claims or plan appropriate safety measures?</p> <p>The core point is that if you can't define something, you can't measure it. If you can't measure it, you can't reliably track progress or identify potential risks. Think about an example from physics - saying something like &quot;it moved 5&quot; makes no sense without specifying the unit of measurement. Did it move 5 meters, 5 feet, or 5 royal cubits? Nobody knows. If we don't know how far or fast it moved, then can we enforce speed limits? Also, no. The same applies to intelligence, and subsequent risks and safety techniques. Just as physics needed standardized units like meters and watts to advance beyond qualitative descriptions, AI safety research needs rigorous definitions to move beyond vague analogies and anthropomorphisms.</p> <p>**What makes defining intelligence so challenging? **If everyone agrees that we need a definition to measure progress and design safety measures, then why don’t we have a universally agreed upon definition? The problem is that the word intelligence is a term we use to describe multiple overlapping abilities - from problem-solving and learning to adaptation and abstract reasoning. Besides this, different academic disciplines view intelligence through different lenses. Psychologists emphasize measurable cognitive skills, computer scientists focus on task performance, and philosophers debate qualities like the relationship of intelligence to consciousness and self-awareness. So which approach is the most relevant to understanding and planning for AI Safety?</p> <p><strong>Case Study: Imitation based approach to intelligence.</strong> The Turing Test (or the imitation game) suggested that intelligence could be measured through a machine's ability to imitate human conversation (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turing, 1950<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).

However, this definition proves problematic on multiple levels. First, consciousness remains poorly understood and difficult to measure. Second, we are unsure if intelligence and consciousness are necessarily linked - a system could potentially be highly intelligent without being conscious, or conscious without being particularly intelligent. A system doesn't need to be conscious to cause harm. Whether an AI system is conscious or not has no bearing on its ability to make high-impact decisions or take potentially dangerous actions.</p> <p><strong>Case Study: Brain analogy based approaches to intelligence.</strong> Another early approach defined AGI in terms of systems that rival or surpass the human brain in complexity and speed. This brain-centric definition is problematic for several reasons. While our brains may be the only example of general intelligence we have, modern AI has shown that matching human neural architecture isn't necessary for achieving intelligent behavior. From a safety perspective, focusing on brain-like architecture tells us little about what risks a system might pose - a system could be very unlike a brain in structure but still be capable of dangerous actions.</p> <p><strong>Case study: Process/Adaptability based approaches to intelligence.</strong> The process-based view sees intelligence as the efficiency of learning and adaptation, rather than accumulated capabilities.

While this focus on meta-learning and adaptation captures something fundamental about intelligence, but from a safety perspective, what ultimately matters is what these systems can actually do - their concrete capabilities - rather than how they achieve these capabilities. This leads us to the final approach.</p> <p><strong>Case study 5: The capabilities approach to intelligence</strong>. The motivating question behind this view is - If an AI system can perform dangerous tasks at human-level or beyond, does it really matter whether it achieved this through sophisticated learning processes, efficient memorization, with/without consciousness? If an AI system has capabilities that could pose risks - like sophisticated planning, manipulation, or deception - these risks exist regardless of whether the system acquired these capabilities through &quot;true intelligence&quot;, &quot;real understanding&quot; or sophisticated pattern matching. The capabilities-based approach cuts through philosophical debates by asking concrete questions: What can the system actually do? How well can it do it? What range of tasks can it handle? This framework provides clear standards for progress and, crucially for safety work, clear ways to identify potential risks. The majority of AI labs use this capabilities-focused approach in how they frame their AGI goals. For example, AGI has been defined as &quot;<em>highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work</em>&quot; (<a href="https://openai.com/charter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI, 2014<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).

Just like we sidestepped debates around whether AIs display &quot;true intelligence&quot; or &quot;real understanding&quot; in favor of a more practical framework that focuses on capabilities, similarly we want to avoid debates around things like whether a system is &quot;human-level&quot; or not.

Rather than waiting for systems to cross some &quot;AGI threshold,&quot; we can identify specific combinations of performance and generality that warrant increased safety measures. For example:</p> <ul><li><p>A system achieving 90% performance on 30% of tasks might require different safety protocols than one achieving 60% performance on 70% of tasks</p></li> <li><p>Certain capability combinations might enable dangerous emergent behaviors even before reaching &quot;human-level&quot; on most tasks</p></li> <li><p>The rate of improvement along either axis provides important signals about how quickly additional safety measures need to be developed</p></li></ul> <p>There are various other variables that we can add to make this picture even more precise. For example, just like we have levels of performance and generality, we can also have levels of autonomy with which these systems operate. As an example, at a low level of autonomy a human fully controls a task and uses AI to automate mundane sub-tasks, whereas at a higher level of autonomy we might see the AI take on a substantive role,or even co-equal work division.

This hasn't always been true. Early in the history of artificial intelligence, researchers took very different approaches to creating intelligent systems. They believed that the key to artificial intelligence was carefully encoding human knowledge and expertise into computer programs. This led to things like expert systems filled with hand-crafted rules and chess engines programmed with sophisticated strategic principles. However, time and time again, researchers learned what we now call the bitter lesson.</p> <p>!!! quote &quot;The Bitter Lesson (<a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sutton, 2019<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>)&quot;</p> <tab><p><em>The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin.

The bitterness comes from discovering that decades of careful human engineering and insight were ultimately less important than simple algorithms plus computation. In chess, researchers who had spent years encoding grandmaster knowledge watched as &quot;brute force&quot; search-based approaches like Deep Blue defeated world champion Garry Kasparov. In computer vision, hand-crafted feature detectors were outperformed by convolutional neural networks that learned their own features from data.

The transformer architecture for example might seem to contradict the bitter lesson because they rely on sophisticated architectural innovations. Human ingenuity is important, but the subtlety is in recognizing that there's a difference between two types of human engineering:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Algorithm-level improvements:</strong> These make better use of existing compute, like: better optimizers (Adam), architecture innovations (transformers, attention mechanisms) or training approaches (better learning rate schedules).</p></li> <li><p><strong>Domain-specific engineering improvements:</strong> These try to encode human knowledge, like: special architectures designed for specific problems, hand-crafted features or rules or task-specific inductive biases.</p></li></ul> <p>The bitter lesson isn't arguing against all human engineering - it's specifically cautioning against the second type. The transformer architecture exemplifies this pattern - it doesn't encode any specific knowledge about language, but rather provides a general mechanism for learning patterns that becomes increasingly powerful as we scale up compute and data.</p> <p><strong>What does the bitter lesson mean for AI Safety?</strong> In the previous section, we discussed measuring AI capabilities along continuous dimensions of performance and generality. If it is the case that these continue to advance primarily through scaling, then we may have more predictable trajectories. This creates both opportunities and risks because performance and generality will continue to rise as long as scale is all that we need, but it also means that forecasting AI development trajectories and preparing appropriate safety measures for predictable capability levels is possible.</p> <h1 id="scaling-laws"><a href="#scaling-laws" class="header-anchor">#</a> Scaling Laws</h1> <p><strong>Why do AI labs care about scaling laws?</strong> Training large AI models is extremely expensive - potentially hundreds of millions of dollars for frontier models. Scaling laws help labs make crucial decisions about resource allocation: Should they spend more on GPUs or on acquiring training data? Should they train a larger model for less time or a smaller model for longer? For example, with a fixed compute budget, they might need to choose between training a 20-billion parameter model on 40% of their data or a 200-billion parameter model on just 4%. Getting these tradeoffs wrong can waste enormous resources. So it is important to be able to have a predictable relationship between how you invest your money and what level of capabilities you get at the end.</p> <p><img src="Images/9Is_Image_21.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></p> <p><em><strong>Figure</strong></em>*: Example of capabilities increasing with an increasing with one of variables in the scaling laws - parameter count.

These are empirical power-law relationships that have been observed to hold across many orders of magnitude. The key variables involved are:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Compute (C)</strong>: This represents the total processing power used during training, measured in floating-point operations (FLOPs). Think of this as the training &quot;budget&quot; - more compute means either training for longer, using more powerful hardware, or both. While having more GPUs helps increase compute capacity, compute ultimately refers to the total number of operations performed, not just hardware.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Parameters (N)</strong>: These are the tunable numbers in the model that get adjusted during training - like knobs that the model can adjust to better fit the data. More parameters allow the model to learn more complex patterns but require more compute per training step. Current frontier models have hundreds of billions of parameters.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dataset size (D)</strong>: This measures how many examples the model trains on (typically measured in tokens for language models). The larger the dataset, the more information the model can read. Simultaneously, to read and learn from more data, the training runs also need to be generally longer, which in turn increases the total compute needed before the model can be considered “trained”. While researchers initially focused on scaling parameters, we've learned that the relationship between compute, parameters, and data is crucial - many early models were actually trained with suboptimal ratios between these variables.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Loss (L)</strong>: This measures how well the model performs on its training objective. This is what we are trying to minimize, and it tends to improve as we scale up these variables.</p></li></ul> <p><img src="Images/nQO_Image_18.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></p> <p><em><strong>Figure</strong></em>*: OpenAIs Scaling Laws showing impact of each variable on performance (loss) (<strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaplan et al., 2020<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></strong>)*</p> <p><strong>OpenAI's initial scaling laws in 2020</strong>. To determine the relationships between different variables that might contribute to scale, OpenAI conducted a series of experiments. For an intuitive idea of how they came up with the scaling laws, you can imagine that while training a model you can hold some variables fixed while varying others and see how loss changes. Eventually this allows you to see some patterns. As an example, dataset size can be kept constant, while parameter count and training time are varied, or parameter count is kept constant and data amounts are varied, etc… So we can get a measurement of the relative contribution of each towards overall performance. If these relationships hold true across many different model architectures and tasks, then this suggests they capture something fundamental about deep learning systems. This is how the first generation of scaling laws came about from OpenAI. For example, by these laws if you have a 10x more compute, you should increase model size by about 5x and data size by only 2x.

DeepMind found that most large language models were actually significantly overparameterized for the amount of data they were trained on. The Chinchilla scaling laws showed that for optimal performance, models should be trained on approximately 20 times more data tokens than they have parameters. This meant that many leading models could have achieved better performance with smaller sizes, but with more data. They were called chinchilla scaling laws because the laws were demonstrated using a model called Chinchilla. This was a 70B parameter model trained on more data, which outperformed much larger models like Gopher (280B parameters) despite using the same amount of compute. So by these laws, for optimal performance, you should increase model size and dataset size in roughly equal proportions - if you get 10x more compute, you should make your model ~3.1x bigger and your data ~3.1x bigger.

Ongoing research showed that performance doesn't always improve smoothly - there can be sharp transitions, temporary plateaus, or even periods where performance gets worse before getting better. Examples of this include things like &quot;Grokking&quot;, where models suddenly achieve strong generalization after many training steps, or deep double descent, where increasing model size initially hurts then helps performance. Rather than simple power laws, BNSL uses a more flexible functional form that can capture these complex behaviors. This allows for more accurate predictions of scaling behavior, particularly around discontinuities and transitions. Scaling laws are a good baseline, but according discontinuous jumps in capabilities and abrupt step changes are still possible.

Another way that we might not be accounting for using scaling laws, is called inference time scaling. This instead uses more compute at runtime through techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, repeated sampling, or tree search. For example, you can either train a very large model that generates high-quality outputs directly, or train a smaller model that achieves similar performance by using more computation to think through problems step by step at inference time.</p> <h1 id="scaling-hypothesis"><a href="#scaling-hypothesis" class="header-anchor">#</a> Scaling Hypothesis</h1> <p><strong>What is the strong scaling hypothesis?</strong> The strong scaling hypothesis proposes that simply scaling up current foundation model architectures with more compute and data will be sufficient to reach transformative AI capabilities and potentially even ASI.

Researchers have been developing algorithms that follow the bitter lesson's principle for many years (focusing on general methods that leverage compute effectively). But even when researchers have developed sophisticated algorithms following the bitter lesson's principles, these improvements still only account for 35% of performance gains in language models in 2024, with the remaining 65% coming purely from increased scale in compute and data (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ho et al., 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). Basically, even when our algorithmic improvements align perfectly with the bitter lesson, they're still far less important than raw scaling.</p> <p>The emergence of unexpected capabilities provides another powerful argument for strong scaling. We've seen previous generations of foundation models demonstrate remarkable abilities that weren't explicitly trained for, like programming for example. This emergent behavior hints that it is not impossible for higher-order metacognitive abilities like causal reasoning to similarly emerge simply as a function of scale. We see that bigger models become increasingly sample efficient - they require fewer examples to learn new tasks. This improved efficiency with scale suggests that scaling up further could eventually lead to human-like few-shot learning capabilities, which is a precursor for TAI and ASI. Finally,  these models also appear to be capable of learning any task that can be expressed through their training modalities. Right now this is text for LLMs but there is a clear path forward to multimodal LMMs. Since text can express virtually any human-comprehensible task, scaling up language understanding might be sufficient for general intelligence.</p> <p>**What are the key arguments against the strong scaling hypothesis? **Recent research has also identified several challenges to the strong scaling hypothesis. The most immediate is data availability - language models will likely exhaust high-quality public text data between 2026 and 2032 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04325" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Villalobos et al., 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). While synthetic data might help address this limitation, it's unclear whether it can provide the same quality of learning signal as organic human-generated content. Alternatively, we still have a lot of multi-modal data left to train on (like YouTube videos) despite running out of text data.</p> <p>A more fundamental challenge comes from the way these models work. LLMs are fundamentally &quot;interpolative databases&quot; (or stochastic parrots , or a variety of other similar terms). The point being that they just build up a vast collection of vector transformations through pre-training. While these transformations become increasingly sophisticated with scale, critics argue there's a fundamental difference between recombining existing ideas and true synthesis - deriving novel solutions from first principles. However, this is not an airtight case against strong scaling. This could simply be a limitation of current scale - a larger model trained on multimodal data might learn to handle any new novel situation simply as a recombination of previously memorized patterns. So, it is unclear if template recombination actually does have an upper bound.</p> <p><strong>What is the weak scaling hypothesis?</strong> Given these challenges, a weaker version of the scaling hypothesis has also been proposed. According to the weak scaling hypothesis even though scale will continue to be the primary driver of progress, we will also need targeted architectural and algorithmic improvements to overcome specific bottlenecks. These improvements wouldn't require fundamental breakthroughs, but rather incremental enhancements to better leverage scale.

Since one third is still a non-trivial role to play in capabilities improvement. Some more empirical observations also support weak scaling. Like hardware support for lower-precision calculations, which provided order-of-magnitude performance improvements for machine learning workloads (Hobbhahn et al., 2023, &quot;Trends in Machine Learning Hardware&quot;). These kinds of targeted improvements don't change the fundamental scaling story but rather help us better leverage available resources. Similarly, the Chinchilla results showed that many models were poorly optimized along the different variables that contribute to capabilities. This suggests that there is still room for improvement through better scaling strategies rather than fundamental breakthroughs.

They don't account for improvements in AI &quot;scaffolding&quot; (like chain-of-thought prompting, tool use, or retrieval), or combinations of multiple models working together in novel ways. Debates around the scaling laws only tell us about the capabilities of a single foundation model trained in a standard way. For example, by the strong scaling hypothesis we can reach TAI by simply scaling up the same foundation model until meta cognitive abilities emerge. But even if scaling stops, halting capabilities progress on the core foundation model (in either a weak or a strong way), the external techniques that leverage the existing model can still continue advancing.</p> <p>Think of foundation models like LLMs or LMMs as simply one transistor. Alone they might not be able to do much, but if we combine enough transistors we end up with all the capabilities of a supercomputer. Many researcher think that this is a crucial element where future capabilities will come from.

Realistically, the future is probably going to see both improvement due to scaffolding and scale. So for now, there does not seem to be an upper limit on improving capabilities as long as either one of the two hold.*</p> <p>We go deeper into the arguments and counterarguments for all views on scaling foundation models in the appendix.</p> <p>!!! note &quot;Argument: Against scaling - Memorization vs Synthesis&quot;</p> <tab><p>This is a slightly deeper dive into trying to understand the argument of both sides if you are interested. It is slightly more technical, and can be safely skipped.</p> <p>When we talk about LLMs as &quot;interpolative databases&quot;, we're referring to how they store and manipulate vector programs - these shou;dnt be confused with traditional computer programs like python or C++. These templates, or vector programs are transformations in the model's embedding space. Early work on embeddings showed simple transformations (like king - man + woman = queen), but modern LLMs can store millions of much more complex transformations. But due to a function of scale, LLMs can now store arbitrarily complex vector functions — so complex, in fact, that researchers found it more accurate to refer to them as vector programs rather than functions.</p> <p>So what's happening in LLMs is that they build up a vast database of these vector programs through pre-training. When we say they're doing &quot;template matching&quot; or &quot;memorization&quot;, what we really mean is that they're storing millions of these vector transformations that they can retrieve and combine with each prompt.</p> <p>So the deciding question for/against strong (and even weak scaling) becomes - Is this type of template program combination enough to reach general intelligence. In other words can program synthesis be approximated using recombinations of enough templates (also called abstractions and many other words but the key idea is the same).</p> <p>People who argue against this say that no matter how numerous or sophisticated, are fundamentally different from true program synthesis. True program synthesis would mean deriving a new solution from first principles - not just recombining existing transformations. There are some empirical observations to support this view. Like the Caesar cipher example: &quot;LLMs can solve a Caesar cipher with key size 3 or 5, but fail with key size 13, because they've memorized specific solutions rather than understanding the general algorithm&quot; (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL9jEy99Nh0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chollet, 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).

But how can we actually predict where AI capabilities are headed? This section introduces key forecasting methodologies that help us anticipate AI progress and prepare appropriate safety measures.</p> <p><strong>Why should we care about forecasting?</strong> Forecasting AI progress is critical for AI safety work. The timeline to transformative AI shapes everything from research priorities to governance frameworks – if we expect transformative AI within 5 years versus 50 years, this dramatically changes which safety approaches are viable. For example, if we expect rapid progress, we might need to focus on safety measures that can be implemented quickly rather than long-term theoretical research. Additionally, understanding likely development trajectories helps us anticipate specific capabilities and prepare targeted safety measures before they emerge. This is especially critical given the potential for sudden capability jumps, especially in dangerous capabilities like malware generation or deception.</p> <p>!!! question &quot;Initial Forecast&quot;</p> <tab><p>Before we explore more sophisticated methods, make an initial prediction: When do you think we'll see transformative AI? Keep this forecast in mind as we examine different forecasting approaches.</p></tab> <h2 id="methodology"><a href="#methodology" class="header-anchor">#</a> Methodology</h2> <p><strong>How do we convert beliefs into probabilities and forecasts?</strong> We need some ways to actually convert beliefs like &quot;I think AGI is likely this decade&quot; into precise probability estimates. One way we can do this is by decomposition - breaking down complex beliefs into smaller, measurable components and analyzing relevant data. Rather than directly estimating the year in which transformative AI emerges, we can start by separately forecasting things like compute growth, algorithmic progress, and hardware limitations, and then combine these estimates (<a href="https://forecasting-sp24.quarto.pub/forecasting-sp24/estimation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zhang, 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). This decomposition approach helps us ground predictions in observable trends rather than relying purely on intuitions. So, using this approach there are two main techniques we need to discuss - zeroth-order forecasting for establishing baselines, and first-order forecasting for understanding trajectories of change.</p> <p><strong>What are reference classes and why do they matter?</strong> When analyzing each component of our decomposed forecast, we need relevant historical examples to inform our predictions. This is where reference classes come in - they are categories of similar historical situations we can use to make predictions. For AI development, relevant reference classes might include things like previous technological revolutions (like the industrial or computer revolution), other optimization systems (like biological evolution or economies), or the impact of rapid scientific advances (like CRISPR or mRNA vaccines). The basic point is that they should be meaningfully analogous to what you're trying to predict, but they don't have to be from the same exact category.</p> <p><strong>What is zeroth-order forecasting?</strong> The simplest forecasting approach starts with recognizing that tomorrow often looks pretty close to today. Zeroth-order forecasting uses reference classes - looking at 3-5 similar historical examples and using their average as a baseline prediction. Rather than trying to identify trends or make complex projections, it assumes recent patterns will continue.

For a concrete example of using multiple reference classes in AI safety forecasting: Suppose we want to predict how quickly advanced AI systems might transition from &quot;safe&quot; to &quot;potentially dangerous&quot; capabilities. We could look at:</p> <ul><li><p>How long it took language models to go from generating basic text to being able to plan multi-step deception (an AI-specific reference point)</p></li> <li><p>How quickly nuclear technology transitioned from peaceful to military applications (a dual-use technology reference point)</p></li> <li><p>How rapidly biological techniques like CRISPR went from lab discovery to widespread use requiring safety protocols (a biosafety reference point)</p></li></ul> <p>Looking at these examples collectively might suggest that dangerous capabilities often emerge within 2-5 years of the underlying technical breakthroughs, which could inform how urgently we need to develop safety measures. Major shifts in development patterns tend to be rare, making recent history a decent baseline predictor of the near future. This doesn't mean changes never happen – but it does mean that deviating from recent patterns requires strong evidence.</p> <p><strong>What is first-order forecasting?</strong> While zeroth-order forecasting uses historical examples from various reference classes as direct predictors, first-order forecasting attempts to identify and project forward patterns in the direct historical data of AI development. In AI, we see some pretty consistent exponential growth patterns. The compute used in frontier models has grown by 4.2x annually since 2010, training datasets have expanded by approximately 2.9x per year, and hardware performance improves by roughly 1.35x every year through architectural advances (<a href="https://epoch.ai/trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Epoch AI, 2023<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). First-order forecasting tries to identify these kinds of patterns and project them forward. This is the approach taken by most systematic AI forecasting work today, including Epoch AI's compute-centric framework and Ajeya Cotra's biological anchors. However, it's worth keeping in mind that even though these trends have been remarkably consistent, they can't continue indefinitely. Physical, thermodynamic, or economic constraints will eventually limit growth. The key question is: when do these limits become relevant? We will explore this in the next section on the compute centric framework.</p> <p><strong>How do we combine different forecasts?</strong> Multiple forecasting approaches often give us different predictions – zeroth-order might suggest one timeline while trend extrapolation indicates another. Just like we can average out over the opinions of many experts, we can integrate these predictions to get a hopefully more accurate picture. One approach is to model each forecast as a probability distribution and combine them using mixture models (<a href="https://forecasting-sp24.quarto.pub/forecasting-sp24/combining-forecasts-new.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steinhardt, 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). For example, if zeroth-order forecasting suggests 3-4 years between major breakthroughs based on recent history, while trend extrapolation points to 1.5-2 years based on compute growth, a combined model might predict 2-3 years but with wider confidence intervals to account for uncertainty in both approaches.</p> <p>**What about situations with limited data or limited reference classes? **While decomposition, reference classes and trend analysis form the backbone of AI forecasting, we sometimes face questions where direct data is limited or no clear reference classes exist. For instance, predicting the societal impact of advanced AI systems or forecasting novel capabilities that haven't been demonstrated before. In these cases, we often turn to expert judgment and superforecasters. An advantage of expert forecasting is the ability to integrate qualitative insights that might be missed by pure trend analysis. For example, experts might notice early warning signs of diminishing returns or identify emerging technical approaches that could accelerate progress. This balanced use of both data-driven methods and expert judgment is especially important for AI safety work. While we should ground our predictions in empirical trends whenever possible, we also need frameworks for reasoning about unprecedented developments and potential discontinuities in progress.</p> <p><strong>How far do empirical findings generalize?</strong> There's an ongoing debate about how much we can trust current trends to predict future AI development. Some researchers argue that empirical findings in AI generalize surprisingly far - that patterns we observe today will continue to hold even as systems become more capable (<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ekFMGpsfhfWQzMW2h/empirical-findings-generalize-surprisingly-far" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steinhardt, 2022<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). However, our track record with forecasting suggests we should be cautious. When superforecasters predicted MATH dataset accuracy would improve from 44% to 57% by June 2022, actual performance reached 68% - a level they had rated extremely unlikely. Shortly after, GPT-4 achieved 86.4% accuracy. There are a couple of more examples of LLMs surprising most forecasters and experts on certain benchmarks.

Prior to GPT-3, many experts believed tasks like complex reasoning would require specialized architectures. The emergence of these capabilities from scaling alone shows how systems can develop unexpected abilities simply through quantitative improvements. This has critical implications for both forecasting and governance - we need frameworks that can adapt to capabilities emerging faster or differently than current trends suggest.</p> <p>**How does this help us predict transformative AI? **These forecasting fundamentals help us critically evaluate claims about AI timelines and takeoff scenarios. When we encounter predictions about discontinuous progress or smooth scaling, we can ask: What trends support this view? What reference classes are relevant? How have similar forecasts performed historically?

To find a reference class, assume that the human brain is indicative of general intelligence. This means we can treat it as a proof of concept. Whatever “amount of compute” it takes to train a human being, might be roughly the same amount it should take to train a TAI. The biological anchors approach estimates the compute required for AI to reach a level of intelligence comparable to humans, outlined through several steps:</p> <ul><li><p>First, assess how much computation the human brain performs, translating this into a quantifiable measure similar to computer operations in FLOP/s.</p></li> <li><p>Second, estimate the amount of computation needed to train a neural network to match the brain's inferential capacity, adjusting for future improvements in algorithmic efficiency.</p></li> <li><p>Third, examine when it would be feasible to afford such vast computational resources, taking into account the decreasing cost of compute, economic growth, and increasing investment in AI.</p></li> <li><p>Finally, by analyzing these factors, we can predict when it might be economically viable for AI companies to deploy the necessary resources for developing TAI.</p></li></ul> <p>Determining the exact computational equivalent for the human brain's training process is complex, leading to the proposal of six hypotheses, collectively referred to as &quot;biological anchors&quot; or &quot;bioanchors.&quot; Each anchor has a different weighting contributing to the overall prediction.</p> <p>Evolution Anchor: Total computational effort across all evolutionary history.</p> <p>Lifetime Anchor: Brain's computational activity from birth to adulthood (0-32).</p> <p>Neural Network and Genome Anchors: Various computational benchmarks based on the human brain and genome to gauge the scale of parameters needed for AI to achieve general intelligence.</p> <p><strong>Forecasting with Biological Anchors</strong>. By integrating these anchors with projections of future compute accessibility, we can outline a potential timeline for TAI. This method aims to provide a &quot;soft upper bound&quot; on TAI's arrival rather than pinpointing an exact year, acknowledging the complexity and unpredictability of AI development.

It can be safely skipped.&quot;</p> <p>This refers to the total computational activity the human brain performs over a human lifetime. This anchor is essentially a measure of the &quot;training&quot; a human brain undergoes from birth to adulthood and incorporates factors such as the number of neurons in the human brain, the amount of computation each neuron performs per year, and the number of years it takes for a human to reach adulthood. The human brain has an estimated 86 billion neurons. Each of these neurons performs a certain number of computations per second, which can be calculated as a certain number of operations per second in FLOP/s. When calculating the total amount of compute over a lifetime, these factors are multiplied together, along with the number of years a human typically lives.</p> <p>For example, if we assume that a neuron is able to perform about 1000 operations per second, and there are about 31.5 million seconds in a year, then a single neuron would perform about 31.5 billion operations in a year. Now, if we multiply this by the estimated number of neurons in the human brain (86 billion), we get an estimate of the total brain-compute performed in one year.

While deep learning currently dominates AI advances, the possibility of new, transformative methodologies emerging remains open, challenging the assumption that current trends will linearly continue into the future.</p></li></ul> <p>This is not an exhaustive list of all the criticisms but it serves to highlight the complexity of forecasting AI's future.</p> <h1 id="takeoff"><a href="#takeoff" class="header-anchor">#</a> Takeoff</h1> <p>This section introduces the concept of AI takeoff. There is much debate about how AI development will play out in the future. The main questions to consider are:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Speed</strong>: How quickly do AI systems become more powerful?</p></li> <li><p><strong>Continuity</strong>: Does the speed progress in sudden jumps or is the speed gradual?</p></li> <li><p><strong>Homogeneity</strong>: How similar are the AI systems to each other?</p></li> <li><p><strong>Polarity</strong>: How many AI systems do we see vying for power in the world?</p></li></ul> <p><strong>Takeoff vs. Timelines</strong>. The difference between these two concepts is subtle, and forecasts in one domain affect the outlooks in the other. However, both takeoff and timelines offer some distinct insights: timelines provide a countdown to AI breakthroughs, while takeoff dynamics forecast the speed and breadth of their societal impact. Understanding both perspectives is key to preparing for the future of AI, guiding safety measures, policy development, and strategic research investment.</p> <h2 id="speed"><a href="#speed" class="header-anchor">#</a> Speed</h2> <p><strong>Takeoff Speeds</strong>. Slow and fast takeoff scenarios offer contrasting views on AI's future trajectory, emphasizing different challenges and preparation strategies. While slow takeoff allows for iterative safety measures and societal adaptation, fast takeoff underscores the urgency of robust, pre-established safety frameworks. Understanding both dynamics is crucial for informed AI governance, safety research, and policy development, ensuring readiness for a range of possible futures.</p> <p><strong>Slow takeoff</strong>. This refers to a scenario where AI capabilities improve in a gradual and measured manner over a relatively longer temporal interval, which could be years or even decades. Note that the &quot;speed&quot; of the takeoff is not just about the raw increase in AI capabilities, but also about the societal and economic impact of those capabilities. Slow takeoff's advantage lies in the preparation time it affords, potentially allowing us to adapt, respond, and correct course if things go wrong. However, on the other hand, more time being exposed to a certain growth trajectory might also breed complacency. It might also be the case that most preparations undertaken before the onset of a slow takeoff would be rendered obsolete as better solutions gradually become visible which utilize new AI capabilities. In a slow takeoff scenario, humanity’s fate essentially depends on preparations put in place during the times when such growth is apparent. The terms &quot;slow takeoff&quot; and &quot;soft takeoff&quot; are often used interchangeably.</p> <p><strong>Fast takeoff</strong>. A &quot;fast takeoff&quot; envisages AI's leap to superintelligence in a short timeframe, such as hours or days, limiting human capacity for response or control. This speed leaves little to no room for humans to react, adapt, or manage the situation. Fast takeoff scenarios highlight the critical importance of preemptive safety and alignment efforts, as the window for post-emergence intervention could be minimal. Given such a short time to react, local dynamics of the takeoff become relevant. The primary mechanism behind a fast takeoff is often considered to be 'recursive self-improvement' through an “intelligence explosion”, where the AI system continually improves its own intelligence and capabilities. We talk about an intelligence explosion, and discontinuity in the next subsection. Terms like “fast takeoff”, “hard takeoff” and “FOOM” are often used interchangeably.</p> <p><strong>Speed vs. Continuity.</strong> We observe that AI systems are created in discrete &quot;events&quot;, sometimes many months or years apart. As an example GPT-3 was released in June 2020, and GPT-4 was released in March 2023. Is there a sudden, extremely large jump between such releases? or could the capabilities have been predicted by extrapolating trends? Where speed might be a measure of how quickly the AI becomes superintelligent, continuity can be thought of as a measure of &quot;surprise&quot;. Continuity measures the predictability and pattern of AI advancements, focusing on whether these advancements occur through gradual, steady improvements or unexpected breaks in previous technological trends. Even though we are presenting speed and continuity separately, the distinction between them is extremely nuanced. They are very related concepts, so much so that oftentimes most researchers use slow takeoff as analogous to continuous takeoff, and fast takeoff as analogous to discontinuous takeoff, making no distinction whatsoever.</p> <p><strong>Continuous takeoff</strong>. Continuous takeoff depicts AI's progression as an extension of existing trends, where advancements are made incrementally. An example is the steady advancement of technology witnessed during the Industrial Revolution, where each decade produced slightly better tools and machinery. The term 'continuous' in this context borrows from mathematical terminology, where a function is considered continuous if it doesn't have any abrupt changes or discontinuities. Some people prefer the term 'gradual' or 'incremental' over 'continuous' as they find it more descriptive and mathematically accurate.</p> <p><strong>Discontinuous Takeoff</strong>. The term 'discontinuous' in this context suggests that there are sudden jumps in capabilities, rather than being a smooth, gradual increase. This means that the AI system makes leaps that significantly exceed what would be expected based on past progress. In a discontinuous takeoff scenario, the AI's capabilities quickly surpass human control and understanding. The terms 'fast takeoff' and 'discontinuous takeoff' are often used interchangeably. However, the images below displaying different takeoff trajectories might help in clarifying the subtle differences between the concepts.</p> <p><img src="Images/kIj_Image_27.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></p> <p><em><strong>Figure</strong></em>*: A comparative illustration of combinations of slow and fast takeoff, alongside continuity.

This could be due to shared underlying foundation models, common APIs, or similar training methods. The uniformity of AI systems under a homogenous takeoff scenario might imply the potential for easy cooperation between AI entities. Additionally, if homogeneity arises due to fine-tuning prevailing as the paradigm; the alignment of the initial AI system becomes the crucial factor for the alignment of all subsequent AI systems. A single misaligned system could, therefore, have widespread consequences, underscoring the importance of rigorous alignment and safety measures in early AI development stages. Homogeneity could either mitigate risks or exacerbate them, depending on the alignment and governance frameworks established during the initial phases of AI development.</p> <p><strong>Heterogeneity</strong>. A heterogeneous takeoff scenario represents diversity and variation in the development, safety levels, and deployment of AI systems. Several factors contribute to the heterogeneity in AI takeoff. First is the diversity in AI development approaches. Organizations and researchers might adopt different strategies and technologies, leading to varied outcomes in terms of AI capabilities and alignment. Moreover, competitive dynamics among AI projects could exacerbate this diversity, as teams race to achieve breakthroughs without necessarily aligning on methodologies or sharing crucial information. As an example, we might have a future where AI becomes a strategic national asset, and AI development is closely guarded. In this environment, the pursuit of AI capabilities becomes siloed, each company or country would then employ different development methodologies, potentially leading to a wide range of behaviors, functionalities, and safety levels.</p> <h2 id="polarity"><a href="#polarity" class="header-anchor">#</a> Polarity</h2> <p>Takeoff polarity in the context of AI development explores how power and control might be distributed during the critical phase when AI systems transition to higher levels of intelligence and capability. It measures whether we will see power centralized in the hands of a single entity or dispersed among various actors.</p> <p><strong>Unipolar Takeoff</strong>. In a unipolar takeoff scenario, the landscape is characterized by the emergence of a single AI system or entity that achieves a significant lead over all others. This lead could be due to a breakthrough that allows for a sudden leap in capabilities, enabling this entity to outpace competitors rapidly, or due to something like an intelligence explosion. The concept hinges on the idea that early advantages in AI development—be it through technological breakthroughs, resource accumulation, or strategic positioning—could allow one project to dominate the field. This dominance could then be used to consolidate power, leveraging economic gains and network effects to maintain a hold over AI advancements and their applications.</p> <p><strong>Multipolar Takeoff</strong>. Conversely, a multipolar takeoff scenario envisions a more balanced distribution of advanced AI systems across multiple entities. This diversity could stem from slower, more incremental progress in AI capabilities, allowing various projects to evolve in tandem without any single entity pulling decisively ahead. Factors contributing to a multipolar landscape include widespread sharing of technological advancements, collaborative efforts to ensure safety and alignment, and regulatory environments that promote competition and mitigate monopolistic outcomes. A unipolar scenario raises concerns about the concentration of power and the potential for misuse of advanced AI capabilities, while a multipolar world presents challenges in coordination among diverse entities or AI systems.</p> <p>Factors Influencing Polarity. Several key elements influence whether takeoff polarity leans towards a unipolar or multipolar outcome:</p> <ul><li><p>Speed of AI Development: A rapid takeoff might favor a unipolar outcome by giving a significant advantage to the fastest developer. In contrast, a slower takeoff could lead to a multipolar world where many entities reach advanced capabilities more or less simultaneously.</p></li> <li><p>Collaboration vs. Competition: The degree of collaboration and openness in the AI research community can significantly affect takeoff polarity. High levels of collaboration and information sharing could support a multipolar outcome, while secretive or highly competitive environments might push towards unipolarity.</p></li> <li><p>Regulatory and Economic Dynamics: Regulatory frameworks and economic incentives also play a crucial role. Policies that encourage diversity in AI development and mitigate against the accumulation of too much power in any single entity's hands could foster a multipolar takeoff.</p></li></ul> <h2 id="takeoff-arguments"><a href="#takeoff-arguments" class="header-anchor">#</a> Takeoff Arguments</h2> <p><strong>The Overhang Argument</strong>. There might be situations where there are substantial advancements or availability in one aspect of the AI system, such as hardware or data, but the corresponding software or algorithms to fully utilize these resources haven't been developed yet. The term 'overhang' is used because these situations imply a kind of 'stored’ or ‘latent’ potential. Once the software or algorithms catch up to the hardware or data, there could be a sudden unleashing of this potential, leading to a rapid leap in AI capabilities. Overhangs provide one possible argument for why we might favor discontinuous or fast takeoffs. There are two types of overhangs commonly discussed:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Hardware Overhang</strong>: This refers to a situation where there is enough computing hardware to run many powerful AI systems, but the software to run such systems hasn't been developed yet. If such hardware could be repurposed for AI, this would mean that as soon as one powerful AI system exists, probably a large number of them would exist, which might amplify the impact of the arrival of human-level AI.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Data Overhang</strong>: This would be a situation where there is an abundance of data available that could be used for training AI systems, but the AI algorithms capable of utilizing all that data effectively haven't been developed or deployed yet.</p></li></ul> <p>Overhangs are also used as a counter argument to why AI pauses do not affect takeoff. One counter argument to the overhang argument is that it relies on the assumption that during the time that we are pausing AI development, the rate of production of chips will remain constant. It could be argued that the companies manufacturing these chips will not make as many chips if data centers aren't buying them. However, this argument only works if the pause is for any appreciable length of time, otherwise the data centers might just stockpile the chips. It is also possible to make progress on improved chip design, without having to manufacture as many during the pause period. However, during the same pause period we could also make progress on AI Safety techniques.

Historical patterns of economic growth, driven by human population increases, suggest a potential for slow and continuous AI takeoff. This argument says that as AIs augment the effective economic population, we might witness a gradual increase in economic growth, mirroring past expansions but at a potentially accelerated rate due to AI-enabled automation. Limitations in AI's ability to automate certain tasks, alongside societal and regulatory constraints (e.g. that medical or legal services can only be rendered by humans), could lead to a slower expansion of AI capabilities. Alternatively, growth might far exceed historical rates. Using a similar argument for a fast takeoff hinges on AI's potential to quickly automate human labor on a massive scale, leading to unprecedented economic acceleration.</p> <p><strong>Compute Centric Takeoff Argument</strong>. This argument, similar to the Bio Anchors report, assumes that compute will be sufficient for transformative AI. Based on this assumption, Tom Davidson's 2023 report on compute-centric AI takeoff discusses feedback loops that may contribute to takeoff dynamics.</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Investment feedback loop</strong>: There might be increasing investment in AI, as AIs play a larger and larger role in the economy. This increases the amount of compute available to train models, as well as potentially leading to the discovery of novel algorithms. All of this increases capabilities, which drives economic progress, and further incentivizes investment.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Automation feedback loop</strong>: As AIs get more capable, they will be able to automate larger parts of the work of coming up with better AI algorithms, or helping in the design of better GPUs. Both of these will increase the capability of the AIs, which in turn allow them to automate more labor.</p></li></ul> <p>Depending on the strength and interplay of these feedback loops, they can create a self-fulfilling prophecy leading to either an accelerating fast takeoff if regulations don't curtail various aspects of such loops, or a slow takeoff if the loops are weaker or counterbalanced by other factors.

The following argument is put forth by Ajeya Cotra:</p> <p>Currently, human researchers collectively are responsible for almost all of the progress in AI research, but are starting to delegate a small fraction of the work to large language models. This makes it somewhat easier to design and train the next generation of models.</p> <p>The next generation is able to handle harder tasks and more different types of tasks, so human researchers delegate more of their work to them. This makes it significantly easier to train the generation after that. Using models gives a much bigger boost than it did the last time around.</p> <p>Each round of this process makes the whole field move faster and faster. In each round, human researchers delegate everything they can productively delegate to the current generation of models — and the more powerful those models are, the more they contribute to research and thus the faster AI capabilities can improve.

This concept of the 'intelligence explosion' is also central to the conversation around discontinuous takeoff. It originates from I.J. Good's thesis, which posits that sufficiently advanced machine intelligence could build a smarter version of itself. This smarter version could in turn build an even smarter version of itself, and so on, creating a cycle that could lead to intelligence vastly exceeding human capability (<a href="https://intelligence.org/files/IEM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yudkowsky, 2013<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).</p> <p>In their 2012 report on the evidence for Intelligence Explosions, Muehlhauser and Salamon delve into the numerous advantages that machine intelligence holds over human intelligence, which facilitate rapid intelligence augmentation.

Once LLMs can write &quot;better&quot; than humans, their speed will most probably surpass us entirely.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Duplicability</strong>: Machines exhibit effortless duplicability. Unlike humans, they do not need birth, education, or training. While humans predominantly improve individually, machines have the potential to grow collectively. Humans take 20 years to become competent from birth, whereas once we have one capable AI, we can duplicate it immediately. Once AIs reach the level of the best programmer, we can just duplicate this AI. The same goes for other jobs.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Editability</strong>: Machines potentially allow more regulated variations.

For instance, if there’s a prediction market for a presidential election, you can buy shares for the candidate you think will win. If many people believe Candidate A will win, the price of shares for Candidate A goes up, indicating a higher probability of winning.</p> <p>These markets are helpful because they gather the knowledge and opinions of many people, often leading to accurate predictions. For example, a company might use a prediction market to forecast whether a new product will succeed. Employees can buy shares if they believe the product will do well. If the majority think it will succeed, the share price goes up, giving the company a good indication of the product’s potential success.</p> <p>By allowing participants to profit from accurate predictions, these markets encourage the sharing of valuable information and provide real-time updates on the likelihood of various outcomes. The argument is that either prediction markets are more accurate than experts, or experts should be able to make a lot of money from these markets and, in doing so, correct the markets. So the incentive for profit leads to the most accurate predictions.

System 1 is fast, automatic, and intuitive; it's the part of our thinking that handles everyday decisions and judgments without much effort or conscious deliberation. For instance, when you recognize a face or understand simple sentences, you're typically using System 1. On the other hand, System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. It takes over when you're solving a complex problem, making a conscious choice, or focusing on a difficult task. It requires more energy and is more controlled, handling tasks such as planning for the future, checking the validity of a complex argument, or any activity that requires deep focus. Together, these systems interact and influence how we think, make judgments, and decide, highlighting the complexity of human thought and behavior.</p> <p>A key concern is whether LLMs are able to emulate System 2 processes, which involve slower, more deliberate, and logical thinking. Some theoretical arguments about the depth limit in transformers show that they are provably incapable of internally dividing large integers (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02098" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).

This greatly enhances the capabilities of GPT-4, enhancing its capabilities and aligning them more closely with human System 2 operations. Note that this technique is emergent and does not work well with previous models.</p> <p>These results suggest a blurring of the lines between these two systems. System 2 processes may be essentially an assembly of multiple System 1 processes, appearing slower due to involving more steps and interactions with slower forms of memory. This perspective is paralleled in how language models operate, with each step in a System 1 process akin to a constant time execution step in models like GPT. Although these models struggle with intentionally orchestrating these steps to solve complex problems, breaking down tasks into smaller steps (Least-to-most prompting) or prompting them for incremental reasoning (Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting) significantly improves their performance.</p> <p><strong>Are LLMs m****issing an internal <strong><strong>w</strong></strong>orld <strong><strong>m</strong></strong>odel?</strong></p> <p>The notion of a &quot;world model&quot; in AI need not be confined to explicit encoding within an architecture.

A crucial obstacle in this area is catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon where a neural network, upon learning new information, tends to entirely forget previously learned information. This issue is an important focus of ongoing research, aiming to develop AI systems that can retain and build upon their knowledge over time. For example, suppose we train an AI on an Atari game. At the end of the second training, the AI has most likely forgotten how to play the first game. This is an example of catastrophic forgetting.</p> <p>But now suppose we train a large AI on many ATARI games, simultaneously, and even add some Internet text and some robotic tasks. This can just work. For example, the AI GATO is an example of such a training process and exemplifies what we call the <strong>blessing of scale</strong>, which is that what is impossible in small regimes can become possible in large regimes.</p> <p>Other techniques are being developed to solve long-term memory, for example, <strong>Scaffolding-based approaches</strong> have also been employed for achieving long-term memory and continual learning in AI. Scaffolding in AI refers to the use of hard-coded wrappers explicitly programmed structures by humans that involve a for loop to query continuously the model:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>LangChain</strong> addresses these challenges by creating extensive memory banks. LangChain is a Python library that allows LLM to retrieve and utilize information from large datasets, essentially providing a way for AI to access a vast repository of knowledge and use this information to construct more informed responses. However, this approach may not be the most elegant due to its reliance on external data sources and complex retrieval mechanisms. A potentially more seamless and integrated solution could involve utilizing the neural network's weights as dynamic memory, constantly evolving and updating based on the tasks performed by the network.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Voyager:</strong> A remarkable example of a scaffolding-based long-term memory is the AI Voyager, an AI system developed under the &quot;AutoGPT&quot; paradigm. This system is notable for its ability to engage in continuous learning within a 3D game environment like Minecraft. In a single game session, AI Voyager demonstrates the capacity to learn basic controls, achieve initial goals such as resource acquisition, and eventually advance to more complex behaviors, including combat with enemies and crafting tools for gathering sophisticated resources. This demonstrates a significant stride in LLM's ability to learn continually and manage long-term memory within dynamic environments.</p></li></ul> <p>It should be noted that scaffold-based long-term memory is not considered an elegant solution, and purists would prefer to use the system's own weights as long-term memory.</p> <p><strong>Planning</strong></p> <p>Planning is an area that AIs currently struggle with, but there is significant progress. Some paradigms, such as those based on scaffolding, enable task decomposition and breaking down objectives into smaller, more achievable sub-objectives.</p> <p>Furthermore, the paper “<em>Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models</em>” demonstrates that it is possible to use GPT-4 for planning in Natural language in Minecraft.

However, linking these quantitative measures can translate to a qualitative improvement in algorithm quality. An algorithm that achieves near-perfect loss, though, is one that necessarily comprehends all subtleties, and displays enormous adaptability. The fact that the scaling laws are not bending is very significant and means that we can make the model a qualitatively better reasoner.</p> <p><strong>From simple correlations to understanding.</strong> During a training run, GPTs go from basic correlations to deeper and deeper understanding. Initially, the model merely establishes connections between successive words. Gradually, it develops an understanding of grammar and semantics, creating links between sentences and subsequently between paragraphs.

If the model vacillates between &quot;He&quot; or &quot;She,&quot; choosing randomly (50/50 odds), it incurs a loss of 2 bits on the pronoun token when incorrect. The loss for other tokens remains the same in both models. However, since the model is only incorrect half the time, a factor of 1/2 should be applied. This results in a difference of (1/2) * (2/20) = 1/20, or 0.05 bits. Thus, a model within 0.05 bits of the minimal theoretical loss should be capable of understanding even more nuanced concepts than the one discussed above.</p></tab> <p><strong>Text completion is probably an AI-complete test</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-complete" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).</p> <p>**Current LLMs have only as many parameters as small mammals have synapses, no wonder they are still imperfect. **Models like GPT-4, though very big compared to other models, should be noted for their relatively modest scale compared to the size of a human brain. To illustrate, the largest GPT-3 model has a similar number of parameters to the synapses of a hedgehog.  We don't really know how many parameters GPT-4 has, but if it is the same size as PALM, which has 512 B parameters, then GPT-4 has only as many parameters as a chinchilla has synapses.

The paradigm of training foundation models to fine-tune later is accelerating this trend. If we want a generalist base model then we need to provide it with ‘general data’ which is code for all the data we can get our hands on. You have probably heard that models like ChatGPT and PaLM are trained on data from the internet. The internet is the biggest repository of data that humans have. Additionally, as we observed from the Chinchilla papers scaling laws, it is possible that data to train our models is the actual bottleneck, and not compute or parameter count. So the natural question is how much data is left on the internet for us to keep training our models? and how much more data do we humans generate every year?</p> <p><strong>How much data do we generate?</strong></p> <p>The total amount of data generated every single day is on the order of ~463EB (Source: <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/how-much-data-is-generated-each-day-cf4bddf29f/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Economic Forum<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). But in this post, we will assume that models are not training on ‘all the data generated’ (yet), rather they will continue to only train on open-source internet text and image data.

The median projection for the year in which ML models use up all the text on the internet is 2040. Overall, projections by Epochai predict that we will have exhausted high-quality language data before 2026, low-quality language data somewhere between 2030 and 2050, and vision data between 2030 and 2060. This might be an indicator of slowing down ML progress after the next couple of decades. These conclusions from Epochai, like all the other conclusions in this entire leveraging computation section, rely on the unrealistic assumptions that current trends in ML data usage and production will continue and that there will be no major innovations in data efficiency, i.e. we are assuming that the amount of capabilities gained per training datapoint will not change from current standards.</p> <p><img src="Images/sZd_Image_34.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></p> <p><em><strong>Figure</strong></em>*: ML data consumption and data production trends for low-quality text, high-quality text, and images. - Source: Epoch (2023), &quot;<strong><a href="https://epochai.org/trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key trends and figures in Machine Learning<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></strong>&quot;*</p> <p>Even if we run out of Data, many solutions are proposed, from using synthetic data, for example, filtering and preprocessing the data with GPT-3.5 to create a new cleaner dataset, an approach used in the paper &quot;Textbooks are all you need&quot; with models like Phi 1.5B that demonstrate excellent performance for their size through the use of high-quality filtered data, to the use of more efficient trainings, or being more efficient by training on more epochs.</p></tab> <p>=== &quot;<strong>Hardware</strong>&quot;</p> <tab><p>!!! warning &quot;This is extra detail provided for those interested.

Firstly, it reflects the real economic expense of developing machine learning systems, which is essential for forecasting the future of AI development and identifying which actors can afford to pursue large-scale AI projects. Secondly, by combining cost estimates with performance metrics, we can track the efficiency and capabilities of ML systems over time, offering insights into how these systems are improving and where inefficiencies may lie. Lastly, these insights help determine the sustainability of current spending trends and guide future investments in AI research and development, ensuring resources are allocated effectively to foster innovation while managing economic impact.</p> <p>Moore’s Law, which predicts the doubling of transistor density and thus computational power approximately every two years, has historically led to decreased costs of compute power. However, the report finds that spending on ML training has grown much faster than the cost reductions suggested by Moore’s Law. This means that while hardware has become cheaper, the overall expense of training ML systems has escalated due to increasing demand for computational resources. This divergence underscores the rapid pace of advancements in ML and the significant investments required to keep up with the escalating computational demands.</p> <p>To measure the cost of ML training runs, the report employs two primary methods. The first method uses historical trends in the price-performance of GPUs to estimate costs. This approach leverages general trends in hardware advancements and cost reductions over time. The second method bases estimates on the specific hardware used to train the ML systems, such as NVIDIA GPUs, providing a more detailed and accurate picture of the costs associated with particular technologies. Both methods involve calculating the hardware cost—the portion of the up-front hardware cost used for training—and the energy cost, which accounts for the electricity required to power the hardware during training. These calculations provide a comprehensive view of the economic burden of training ML models.</p> <p>Measuring the cost of development extends beyond the final training run of an ML system to encompass a range of factors. This includes research and development costs, which cover the expenditures on preliminary experiments and model refinements that lead up to the final product. It also involves personnel costs, including salaries and benefits for researchers, engineers, and support staff. Infrastructure costs, such as investments in data centers, cooling systems, and networking equipment, are also significant. Additionally, software and tools, including licenses and cloud services, contribute to the overall cost. Energy costs throughout the development lifecycle, not just during the final training run, and opportunity costs—potential revenue lost from not pursuing other projects—are also crucial components. Understanding these broader costs provides a more comprehensive view of the economic impact of developing advanced ML systems, informing strategic decisions about resource allocation.</p> <p>The findings suggest that the cost of ML training runs will continue to grow, but the rate of growth might slow down in the future. The report estimates that the cost of ML training has grown by approximately 2.8 times per year for all systems. For large-scale systems, the growth rate is slower, at around 1.6 times per year. This substantial year-on-year increase in training costs highlights the need for significant efficiency improvements in both hardware and training methodologies to manage future expenses effectively.</p> <p>The report forecasts that if current trends continue, the cost for the most expensive training runs could exceed significant economic thresholds, such as 1% of the US GDP, within the next few decades. This implies that without efficiency improvements, the economic burden of developing state-of-the-art ML systems will increase substantially. Consequently, understanding and managing these costs is essential for ensuring the sustainable growth of AI capabilities and maintaining a balanced approach to AI investment and development.</p> <p><img src="Images/L5n_Image_41.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></p> <p><em><strong>Figure</strong></em>*: estimated cost of compute in US dollars for the final training run of ML systems.
