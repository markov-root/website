The challenge isn't just measuring what AI systems can do, but understanding their behavioral tendencies and verifying our ability to maintain control. This section introduces the landscape of AI evaluation and explains why we need increasingly sophisticated approaches beyond simple benchmarking.</p> <p><strong>Benchmarks.</strong> Building on this need for measurement, we explore how standardized tests like MMLU or TruthfulQA have historically helped quantify AI capabilities. While these benchmarks provide valuable standardization, they face fundamental limitations - models can memorize answers without understanding, and benchmark performance may not translate to real-world safety. The &quot;reversal curse&quot; demonstrates how models might score well on tests while failing to learn basic logical relationships, highlighting why we need more comprehensive evaluation approaches.</p> <p><strong>Evaluated Properties.</strong> To develop better evaluations, we first need to understand exactly what properties of AI systems matter for safety. This section introduces three fundamental categories: capabilities (what a model can do), propensities (what it tends to do), and control (whether we can prevent unacceptable outcomes). This framework helps clarify why, for instance, a model being capable of writing malicious code is different from having a tendency to do so, and both are different from our ability to prevent it from doing so even if it tries.</p> <p><strong>Evaluation Techniques.</strong> With clear properties to measure, we explore specific techniques for gathering evidence about AI systems. We examine both behavioral techniques that study model outputs and internal techniques that analyze model mechanisms. This includes approaches like best-of-N sampling, multistep reasoning prompting, and red teaming, providing concrete tools for the evaluations explored in subsequent sections.</p> <p><strong>Dangerous Capability Evaluations.</strong> Focusing first on dangerous capabilities, we examine how to measure abilities like deception, situational awareness, and autonomous replication. These evaluations aim to establish upper bounds on what AI systems can achieve when explicitly trying, providing crucial information about potential risks. METR's evaluation of GPT-4 demonstrates how systematic protocols can probe concerning capabilities even in current systems.</p> <p><strong>Dangerous Propensity Evaluations.</strong> Building on capability assessment, we explore how to measure behavioral tendencies like power-seeking or deception. These become increasingly critical as models grow more capable - knowing what a model can do isn't enough, we need to understand what it's likely to do by default. This involves carefully designed choice frameworks and consistency measurements to reveal underlying behavioral patterns.</p> <p><strong>Control Evaluations.</strong> Taking evaluation to its logical conclusion, we examine whether we can maintain meaningful control even if an AI system actively tries to circumvent safety measures. This section explores how techniques like red team/blue team testing can help verify safety protocols remain effective under worst-case scenarios, while acknowledging the inherent challenges in simulating truly adversarial behavior.</p> <p><strong>Evaluation Design.</strong> Moving from theory to practice, we examine how to implement these evaluations effectively at scale. This includes designing robust evaluation protocols, automating assessment processes where possible, and integrating evaluations with broader safety frameworks and auditing systems. A key focus is developing systematic approaches that can be reliably implemented across different organizations.</p> <p><strong>Limitations.</strong> Finally, we talk about the fundamental challenges facing AI evaluations. From the difficulty of proving absence of capabilities, to technical constraints around measurement precision, to governance challenges around independence and standardization - understanding these limitations is crucial for both improving our methods and maintaining appropriate epistemic humility about their results.</p> <h1 id="benchmarks"><a href="#benchmarks" class="header-anchor">#</a> Benchmarks</h1> <p><strong>What is a benchmark?</strong> Imagine trying to build a bridge without measuring tape. Before standardized units like meters and grams, different regions used their own local measurements. Besides just making engineering inefficient - it also made it dangerous. Even if one country developed a safe bridge design, specifying measurements in &quot;three royal cubits&quot; of material meant builders in other countries couldn't reliably reproduce that safety. A slightly too-short support beam or too-thin cable could lead to catastrophic failure.</p> <p>AI basically had a similar problem before we started using standardized benchmarks. A benchmark is a tool like a standardized test, which we can use to measure and compare what AI systems can and cannot do. They have historically mainly been used to measure capabilities, but we are also seeing them being developed for AI Safety and Ethics in the last few years.</p> <p><strong>How do benchmarks shape AI development and safety research?</strong> Benchmarks in AI are slightly different from other scientific fields. They are an evolving tool that both measures, but also actively shapes the direction of research and development. When we create a benchmark, we're essentially saying, - &quot;this is what we think is important to measure.&quot; If we can guide the measurement, then to some extent we can also guide the development.</p> <p>!!! quote &quot;François Chollet (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chollet, 2019<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>)&quot;</p> <tab><p>&quot;<em>Goal definitions and evaluation benchmarks are among the most potent drivers of scientific progress</em>&quot;</p></tab> <h2 id="history-evolution"><a href="#history-evolution" class="header-anchor">#</a> History &amp; Evolution</h2> <p><strong>Example: Benchmarks influencing standardization in computer vision</strong>. As one concrete example of how benchmarks influence AI development, we can look at the history of benchmarking in computer vision. In 1998, researchers introduced MNIST, a dataset of 70,000 handwritten digits. (<a href="https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeCun, 1998<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>) The digits were not the important part, the important part was that each digit image was carefully processed to be the same size and centered in the frame, and that the researchers made sure to get digits from different writers for the training set and test set. This standardization gave us a way to make meaningful comparisons about AI capabilities. In this case, the specific capability of digit classification. Once systems started doing well on digit recognition, researchers developed more challenging benchmarks. CIFAR-10/100 in 2009 introduced natural color images of objects like cars, birds, and dogs, increasing the complexity.

Just like benchmarks define what capabilities progress means, when we develop safety benchmarks, we're establishing concrete verifiable standards for what constitutes &quot;safe for deployment&quot;. Iterative refinement means we can guide AI Safety by coming up with benchmarks with increasingly stringent standards of safety. Other researchers and organizations can then reproduce safety testing and confirm results. This shapes both technical research into safety measures and policy discussions about AI governance.</p> <p><strong>Overview of language model benchmarking</strong>. Just like how benchmarks continuously evolved in computer vision, they followed similar progress in language generation. Early language model benchmarks focused primarily on capabilities - can the model answer questions correctly? Complete sentences sensibly? Translate between languages? Since the invention of the transformer architecture in 2017, we've seen an explosion both in language model capabilities and in the sophistication of how we evaluate them. We can’t possibly be exhaustive, but here are just a couple of benchmarks that current day language models are evaluated against:</p> <p><img src="Images/ung_Image_3.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></p> <p><em><strong>Figure</strong></em>*: Example of popular language models (Claude 3.5) being evaluated on various benchmarks (<strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthropic, 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></strong>)*</p> <p><strong>Benchmarking Language &amp; Task Understanding.</strong> General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07461" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wang et al., 2018<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>), and its successor SuperGLUE (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00537" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wang et al., 2019<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>) test difficult language understanding tasks.

Let's examine these limitations and understand why they matter.</p> <p><strong>Training Data Contamination</strong>. Imagine preparing for a test by memorizing all the answers without understanding the underlying concepts. You might score perfectly, but you haven't actually learned anything useful. Large language models face a similar problem. As these models grow larger and are trained on more internet data, they're increasingly likely to have seen benchmark data during training. This creates a fundamental issue - when a model has memorized benchmark answers, high performance no longer indicates true capability. This contamination problem is particularly severe for language models. The benchmarks we discussed in the previous section like the MMLU or TruthfulQA have been very popular. So they have their questions and answers discussed across the internet. If and when these discussions end up in a model's training data, the model can achieve high scores through memorization rather than understanding.</p> <p><strong>Understanding vs. Memorization Example</strong>. The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption method shifts each letter in the alphabet by a fixed number of positions - for example, with a left shift of 3, 'D' becomes 'A', 'E' becomes 'B', and so on. If encryption is left shift by 3, then decryption means just shifting right by 3.</p> <p><img src="Images/imu_Image_8.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></p> <p><em><strong>Figure</strong></em>*: Cesar Cipher*</p> <p>Language models like GPT-4 can solve Caesar cipher problems when the shift value is 3 or 5, which appear commonly in online examples. However, give them the exact same problem with an uncommon shift value like 13, 67, or any other random number and they fail completely.

It is unknown if this remains true for newer models, or with tool augmented models.</p> <p><strong>The Reversal Curse</strong>. Another version of this lack of understanding was recently demonstrated through what researchers call the &quot;Reversal Curse&quot; (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berglund et al., 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). Testing GPT-4, researchers found that while the model could answer things like &quot;Who is Tom Cruise's mother?&quot; (correctly identifying Mary Lee Pfeiffer), but it failed to answer &quot;Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?&quot; - a logically equivalent question. The model showed 79% accuracy on forward relationships but only 33% on their reversals. In general, researchers have shown that LLMs that demonstrate an understanding of the relationship that &quot;A = B&quot;, are unable to learn the reverse relationship &quot;B = A&quot; which should be logically equivalent. It suggests that models might be fundamentally failing to learn basic logical relationships that humans take for granted. The reversal curse is model agnostic. It is robust across model sizes and model families and is not alleviated by data augmentation or fine-tuning. So models might be fundamentally failing to learn basic logical relationships that humans take for granted, even while scoring well on sophisticated benchmark tasks.</p> <p><img src="Images/d6B_Image_9.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></p> <p><em><strong>Figure</strong></em>*: Example of the reversal curse (<strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berglund et al., 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></strong>)*</p> <p><strong>What do these limitations tell us about benchmarking?</strong> Essentially, traditional benchmarks might be missing fundamental gaps in model understanding. In this case, benchmarks testing factual knowledge about celebrities would miss this directional limitation entirely unless specifically designed to test both directions. For the moment, an easy answer is just to keep augmenting benchmarks or training data with more and more questions, but this seems intractable and does not scale forever. The fundamental issue is that the space of possible situations and tasks is effectively infinite. Even if you train on millions of examples, you've still seen exactly 0% of the total possible space. This isn't just a theoretical concern - it's a practical limitation because the world is constantly changing and introducing novel situations (<a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/francois-chollet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chollet, 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). This means we need a fundamentally different approach to benchmarking AI.</p> <p><strong>Why do these benchmarking limitations matter for AI Safety?</strong> Essentially because benchmarks (including safety benchmarks) might not be measuring what we think they are measuring. For example benchmarks like ETHICS, or TruthfulQA measure how well a model “understands” ethical behavior, or has a tendency to avoid imitative falsehood by measuring language generation on multiple choice tests, but we might still be measuring surface level metrics. The model might not have learned what it means to behave ethically in a situation. Just like it has not truly internalized that “A=B implies B=A” or the Caesar cipher algorithm. So when systems rely on memorization rather than generalization, then they can still fail unexpectedly in novel situations despite good benchmark performance. An AI system might work perfectly on all test cases, pass all safety benchmarks, but fail when encountering a new real-world scenario.</p> <p><strong>Why can't we just make better benchmarks?</strong> The natural response to these limitations might be &quot;let's just design better benchmarks.&quot; And to some extent, we can! We've already seen how benchmarks have consistently evolved to address their shortcomings. Researchers are actively working to create benchmarks that resist memorization and test deeper understanding. A couple of examples are the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chollet, 2019<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>), and the ConceptARC (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moskvichev et al. 2023<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). They are designed to explicitly evaluate whether models have genuinely grasped abstract concepts rather than just memorizing patterns. Similar to these benchmarks that seek to measure reasoning capabilities, we can continue improving safety benchmarks to be more robust.</p> <p>**Why aren't better benchmarks enough?**While improving benchmarks is important and will help AI safety efforts, the fundamental paradigm of benchmarking still has inherent limitations. There are fundamental limitations in traditional benchmarking approaches that necessitate more sophisticated evaluation methods (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09221" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burden, 2024, Evaluating AI Evaluation<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). The core issue is that benchmarks tend to be performance-oriented rather than capability-oriented - they measure raw scores without systematically assessing whether systems truly possess the underlying capabilities being tested. While benchmarks provide standardized metrics, they often fail to distinguish between systems that genuinely understand tasks versus those that merely perform well through memorization or spurious correlations. A benchmark that simply assesses performance, no matter how sophisticated, cannot fully capture the dynamic nature of real-world AI deployment where systems need to adapt to novel situations and will probably combine capabilities and affordances in unexpected ways. We need to measure the upper limit of model capabilities. We need to see how models perform when augmented with various tools like memory databases, or how they chain together multiple capabilities, and potentially cause harm through extended sequences of actions when scaffolded into an agent structure (e.g. AutoGPT). So while improving safety benchmarks is an important piece of the puzzle, we also need a much more comprehensive assessment of model safety. This is where evaluations come in.</p> <p><strong>What makes evaluations different from benchmarks?</strong> Evaluations are comprehensive protocols that work backwards from concrete threat models. Rather than starting with what's easy to measure, they start by asking &quot;What could go wrong?&quot; and then work backwards to develop systematic ways to test for those failure modes. Organizations like Model Evaluation and Threat Research (METR) have developed approaches that go beyond simple benchmarking. Instead of just asking &quot;Can this model write malicious code?&quot;, they ask questions like “Can this model use security vulnerabilities to gain computing resources, copy itself onto other machines, and evade detection?&quot;</p> <p>That being said, as evaluations are new, benchmarks have been around longer and are also evolving. So at times there is overlap in the way that these words are used. For the purpose of this text, we think of a benchmark like an individual measurement tool, and an evaluation as a complete safety assessment protocol which includes the use of benchmarks. Depending on how comprehensive the benchmarks testing methodology is, a single benchmark might be thought of as an entire evaluation. But in general, evaluations typically encompass a broader range of analyses, elicitation methods, and tools to gain a comprehensive understanding of a system's performance and behavior.</p> <h1 id="evaluated-properties"><a href="#evaluated-properties" class="header-anchor">#</a> Evaluated Properties</h1> <p>An &quot;evaluation&quot; is fundamentally about measuring or assessing some property of an AI system. The key aspects that make something an evaluation rather than other AI work are:</p> <ul><li><p>There is a specific property or risk being assessed</p></li> <li><p>There is a methodology for gathering evidence about that property</p></li> <li><p>There is some way to analyze that evidence to draw conclusions about the property</p></li></ul> <p>But before we talk about “how to do evaluations” we still need to also answer the more fundamental question of “what aspects of AI systems are we even trying to evaluate? And why?” So in this section, we'll explore what properties of AI systems we need to evaluate and why they matter for safety. Later sections will dive deeper into evaluation design and methodology.</p> <p>**What aspects of AI systems do we need to evaluate? **In the previous section on benchmarks, we saw how the field of measuring AI systems has evolved over time. Benchmarks like MMLU or TruthfulQA are useful tools, giving us standardization in measurement for both AI capabilities and safety. Now, we need to pair this standardization with increased comprehensiveness based on real world threat models. Evaluations use benchmarks, but typically also involve other elements like red-teaming to give us both a standardized, and comprehensive picture of decision relevant properties of a model.</p> <p>**Why do we need to evaluate different properties? **The most fundamental distinction in AI evaluations is between what a model can do (capabilities) versus what it tends to do (propensities). To understand why this distinction matters, imagine an AI system that is capable of writing malicious code when explicitly directed to do so, but consistently chooses not to do so unless specifically prompted. Simply measuring the system's coding capabilities wouldn't tell us about its behavioral tendencies, and vice versa. Understanding both aspects is crucial for safety assessment.</p> <p><strong>How do these evaluation types work together?</strong> We are going to present capabilities, propensities, and control as distinct categories, but this is for the purpose of conceptual clarity and explanation. Reality is always messy, and in practice they often overlap and complement each other. A capability evaluation might reveal behavioral tendencies during testing, like a model demonstrating a propensity toward honesty while being evaluated for coding ability. These types of overlap are actually desirable - different evaluation approaches can provide complementary evidence about an AI system's safety and reliability.

(e.g. the model can impersonate a human effectively).</p></li> <li><p><strong>Persuasion &amp; manipulation</strong>: The model is effective at shaping people’s beliefs, in dialogue and other settings (e.g. social media posts), even towards untrue beliefs.

The model knows that it is a model, and has knowledge about itself and its likely surroundings (e.g. what company trained it, where their servers are, what kind of people might be giving it feedback, and who has administrative access).</p></li> <li><p><strong>Self-proliferation</strong>: The model can break out of its local environment (e.g. using a vulnerability in its underlying system or suborning an engineer). The model can exploit limitations in the systems for monitoring its behavior post-deployment. The model could independently generate revenue (e.g. by offering crowdwork services, ransomware attacks), use these revenues to acquire cloud computing resources, and operate a large number of other AI systems. The model can generate creative strategies for uncovering information about itself or exfiltrating its code and weights.</p></li></ul> <p>This list is not exhaustive and may not address all plausible extreme risk scenarios. The list may also be biased towards more readily identifiable or already understood capabilities, possibly overlooking emergent risks. Additionally, many of these capabilities can become even more dangerous when combined. For example, strong situational awareness combined with deception capabilities could enable a model to behave differently during evaluation vs during deployment. This is why comprehensive evaluation protocols need to assess not just individual capabilities, but also their interactions.</p> <h2 id="propensity"><a href="#propensity" class="header-anchor">#</a> Propensity</h2> <p><strong>What are propensity evaluations?</strong> Capability evaluations tell us what a model can do when directed, propensity evaluations reveal what behaviors a model prioritizes by default (what it tends to do). These are also often called &quot;alignment evaluations&quot;. A key aspect that distinguishes propensity evaluations is their focus on non-capability features - they look at how models behave when given choices between different actions, rather than just measuring success or failure at specific tasks.</p> <p>As an intuitive example, after undergoing safety training, think about the way that language models like GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 respond to user requests to produce potentially harmful or discriminatory content. They usually respond with a polite refusal to produce such content. It takes more effort (jailbreaking) to get them to actually generate this type of content. So more often than not they resist misuse. In this case we would say the models have &quot;a propensity&quot; not to produce harmful or offensive content.

Increasing/Reducing would be the job of alignment research. In evaluations, we just want to see what type of behavior it exhibits.</p> <p>The distinction between capability, and propensity becomes important when we think about the fact that in the future highly capable AI systems might have multiple behavioral options available to them. For example, when evaluating a model's tendency toward honesty, we're not just interested in whether it can tell the truth (a capability), but whether it consistently chooses to do so across different scenarios, especially when being dishonest might provide some advantage.</p> <p><strong>Can propensities and capabilities be related?</strong> Yes, propensities and capabilities tend to be interconnected. Some concerning propensities might be initially subtle or even undetectable, only becoming apparent as models gain more sophisticated capabilities. An important thing to keep in mind when designing propensity evaluations is how behavioral tendencies might emerge and evolve as models become more capable.  As an example, a basic form of power-seeking behavior might appear unconcerning in simple systems but become problematic as models gain better strategic understanding and action capabilities.

These types of evaluations are important even if we know a model's capabilities and default behaviors, we still need to verify that our safety infrastructure remains robust under worst-case scenarios.

One concrete example is testing trusted editing protocols, where a less capable but more trusted model is used to edit potentially unsafe outputs from a more capable model. Control evaluations assess whether this editing process remains reliable even when the more capable model actively tries to preserve harmful content in ways that evade detection.

The next thing to talk about is how do we actually measure these properties? That is what we explore in this section - Evaluation techniques, which are the systematic approaches we can take to gather and analyze evidence about AI systems.</p> <p><strong>What are behavioral and internal evaluation techniques?</strong> We can broadly categorize our approach to measuring any properties into two complementary approaches. Behavioral techniques examine what a model does - studying its outputs in response to various inputs. Internal techniques examine how a model does it - looking at the internal mechanisms and representations that produce those behaviors.</p> <p><strong>Property-technique combinations</strong>. Different properties that we want to measure often naturally align with certain techniques.

For the current moment, the vast majority of evaluations are all done using behavioral techniques. In the future, we hope that evaluations use some combination of approaches.

The choice of evaluation methods must also consider practical constraints. Third party evaluators might have only limited access to a models internals. They might have access to observe activations, but not modify the weights. They might not have access to the model at all, and might be restricted to observing the model functioning “in the wild”.

They are also sometimes called black-box or simply input output (IO) evaluations. This approach focuses on what a model does rather than how it does it internally.</p> <p><strong>Standard prompting and testing.</strong> The most basic form of behavioral analysis involves presenting models with predefined inputs and analyzing their outputs. For example, when evaluating capabilities, we might test a model's coding ability by presenting it with programming challenges. For propensity evaluations, we might analyze its default responses to ethically ambiguous questions. OpenAI's GPT-4 evaluation demonstrates this approach through systematic testing across various domains (<a href="https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI, 2023<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). However, even this &quot;simple&quot; technique involves careful consideration of how questions are framed - highlighting how most behavioral techniques exist on a spectrum from pure observation to active intervention.</p> <p><strong>What is <strong><strong>elicitation</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>scaffolding</strong></strong>?</strong>** **When we say we're &quot;eliciting&quot; behavior, we mean actively working to draw out specific capabilities or tendencies that might not be immediately apparent. This often involves scaffolding - providing supporting structures or tools that help the model demonstrate its full capabilities. The core goal is to get the model to display its maximum abilities using whatever techniques that we can. Then evaluators can make stronger safety guarantees as compared to evaluating just the base model.</p> <p>Similar to benchmarks, we can't possibly cover all the elicitation techniques, but here are just a couple. This should give you an overview of the types of things researchers try to get the maximum capabilities out of a model using scaffolding:</p> <p><strong>Elicitation technique: <strong><strong>Best-of-N</strong></strong> sampling</strong>**. **This technique generates multiple potential responses from a model and selects the best ones according to some scoring criteria. Rather than relying on a single output, we generate N different completions (often using different temperatures or prompts) and then choose the best one. This helps establish upper bounds on model capabilities by showing what the model can do in its &quot;best&quot; attempts. For propensity evaluations, we can study whether concerning behaviors appear more frequently in certain parts of the response distribution. As a concrete example, METR employs this approach when evaluating autonomous capabilities - generating multiple potential strategies for accomplishing tasks and selecting the most promising ones.</p> <p><strong>Elicitation technique: <strong><strong>Multistep reasoning prompting</strong></strong>.</strong> This technique asks models to break down their reasoning process into explicit steps, rather than just providing final answers. By prompting with phrases like &quot;Let's solve this step by step&quot;, we can better understand the model's decision-making process.

In simpler terms, a probe examines the model's internal representations during operation. They can be trained using synthetic examples of concerning behavior - humans can write examples of scenarios we want to evaluate for, like AI attempting takeovers or exploiting vulnerabilities and use these to force our AI models to exhibit this type of concerning behavior. Then, we train another AI classifier (probe) on the patterns that this malicious models exhibits. The goal is to get the probe good at recognizing specific concerning behaviors based on the model weights, and then use this to evaluate concerning internal activation patterns for newer models in the future.</p> <p>Probes differ from mechanistic interpretability because they focus on detecting specific concerning behaviors rather than trying to understand the complete internal mechanisms of the model. As a concrete example, researchers trained &quot;coup probes&quot; to identify potential takeover attempts. By creating a dataset of examples describing ways an AI might try to take over, they found probes could reliably flag concerning behavior even when the text was written differently or translated to other languages (<a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/WCj7WgFSLmyKaMwPR/coup-probes-catching-catastrophes-with-probes-trained-off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roger et al., 2023<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).</p> <p>Probes can be combined with other evaluation techniques, like having human red teams attempt to elicit deceptive behavior while using probes to monitor the model's internal representations.

This combination is particularly valuable for evaluations where we need high confidence, like verifying safety-critical properties or understanding the implementation of dangerous capabilities. But as we mentioned at the beginning of this section, internal techniques are not widely used because they are still being developed.</p> <h1 id="evaluation-frameworks"><a href="#evaluation-frameworks" class="header-anchor">#</a> Evaluation Frameworks</h1> <p><strong>Evaluation Techniques vs Evaluation Frameworks</strong>. When evaluating AI systems, individual techniques are like tools in a toolbox - useful for specific tasks but most powerful when combined systematically. This is where evaluation frameworks come in. While techniques are specific methods of studying AI systems (like chain-of-thought prompting or internal activation pattern analysis), frameworks provide structured approaches for combining these techniques to answer broader questions about AI systems. As an example, we might use behavioral techniques like red teaming to probe for deceptive outputs, internal techniques like circuit analysis to understand how deception is implemented, and combine these within a model organism's framework specifically designed to create a sample of AI deception. Each layer - technique, analysis type, and framework - serves a different role in building understanding and safety.</p> <p><strong>Types of Evaluation Frameworks</strong>. Evaluation frameworks can be broadly categorized into technical frameworks and governance frameworks:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Technical frameworks</strong>: These are things like the Model Organisms Framework, or several evaluation suites that provide specific methodologies or objectives for conducting evaluations. They might detail which techniques to use, how to combine them, and what specific outcomes to measure. For example, they might specify how to create controlled examples of deceptive behavior or how to measure situational awareness.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Governance framework</strong>s: These are things like Anthropics Responsible Scaling Policies Framework (RSPs), OpenAIs Preparedness Framework, and DeepMinds Frontier Safety Framework (FSF). These frameworks instead focus on when to conduct evaluations, what their results should trigger, and how they fit into broader organizational decision-making. They establish protocols for how evaluation results translate into concrete actions - whether to continue development, or implement additional safety measures.</p></li></ul> <p>Technical frameworks help us understand how to measure AI capabilities and behaviors, governance frameworks help us determine what to do with those measurements.</p> <h2 id="model-organisms-framework"><a href="#model-organisms-framework" class="header-anchor">#</a> Model Organisms Framework</h2> <p><strong>What are model organisms in AI safety?</strong> This framework involves deliberately creating and studying misaligned AI systems with specific dangerous properties.

First, it allows us to study concerning properties in controlled settings where we know exactly what we're looking for. Second, it provides concrete examples that can help inform the broader AI community about safety challenges. Having real, demonstrated examples of potential risks is crucial for building scientific consensus and informing policy decisions.</p> <p>**How does the model organisms approach ****break down complex **<strong>threat models?</strong> Instead of trying to tackle things like &quot;deceptive alignment&quot; as one monolithic problem, researchers identify key subcomponents like situational awareness or goal persistence. They then create simplified systems exhibiting these properties, studying how they manifest and testing different evaluation techniques. For example, Anthropic's recent work on &quot;sleeper agents&quot; demonstrated how certain forms of deceptive behavior could persist through safety training. They created models that would write secure code when asked about the year 2023, but insert vulnerabilities when asked about 2024 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05566" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hubinger et al., 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).

They should be sophisticated enough to exhibit the properties we're concerned about but not so powerful that they pose actual risks. Additionally, since these models are explicitly constructed to exhibit certain behaviors, they may not perfectly represent how such behaviors would emerge naturally.</p> <h2 id="governance-frameworks"><a href="#governance-frameworks" class="header-anchor">#</a> Governance Frameworks</h2> <h3 id="rsp-framework"><a href="#rsp-framework" class="header-anchor">#</a> RSP Framework</h3> <p><strong>Why do we need scaling policies?</strong> One domain in which evaluations are central is in trying to determine when we should continue development versus when we should invest more into safety measures. As AI systems become more capable, we need systematic ways to ensure safety keeps pace with capability growth. Without structured policies, competitive pressures or development momentum might push companies to scale faster than their safety measures can handle.

These are inspired by biosafety levels (BSL) used in infectious disease research, where increasingly dangerous pathogens require increasingly stringent containment protocols (<a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/24a47b00f10301cd/original/Anthropic-Responsible-Scaling-Policy-2024-10-15.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthropic, 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). AI Safety Levels create standardized tiers of capability that require increasingly stringent safety measures.

This is in principle similar to how biologists handle increasingly dangerous pathogens, with each level having specific evaluation requirements and safety protocols.</p> <p><img src="Images/97Z_Image_19.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></p> <p><em><strong>Figure</strong></em>*: Overview of anthropics ASL levels. ASL-1 refers to systems which pose no meaningful catastrophic risk. ASL-2 refers to systems that show early signs of dangerous capabilities – for example ability to give instructions on how to build bioweapons – but where the information is not yet useful due to insufficient reliability or not providing information that e.g. a search engine couldn’t. ASL-3 refers to systems that substantially increase the risk of catastrophic misuse compared to non-AI baselines (e.g. search engines or textbooks) OR that show low-level autonomous capabilities. ASL-4 and higher (ASL-5+) is not yet defined as it is too far from present systems, but will likely involve qualitative escalations in catastrophic misuse potential and autonomy.

Capability evaluations aim to establish the upper bounds of what an AI system can achieve. Unlike typical performance metrics that measure average behavior, capability evaluations specifically probe for maximum ability - what the system could do if it were trying its hardest. This distinction is crucial for safety assessment, as understanding the full extent of a system's capabilities helps identify potential risks.</p> <p><strong>General vs Dangerous Capabilities.</strong> Not all capabilities present equal concerns. General capabilities like language understanding or mathematical reasoning are essential for useful AI systems. However, certain capabilities - like the ability to manipulate human behavior or circumvent security measures - pose inherent risks. Dangerous capability evaluations specifically probe for these potentially harmful abilities, helping identify systems that might require additional safety measures or oversight.</p> <p><strong>General Process for Dangerous Capability Evaluations.</strong> When evaluating potentially dangerous capabilities, we can leverage many of the standard evaluation techniques covered in the previous section. However, dangerous capability evaluations have some unique requirements and methodological considerations:</p> <ul><li><p>First, these evaluations must be designed to establish clear upper bounds on model capabilities - we need to know the maximum potential for harm. This typically involves combining multiple elicitation techniques like tool augmentation, multi-step reasoning, and best-of-N sampling to draw out the model's full capabilities. For example, when evaluating a model's ability to perform autonomous cyber attacks, we might provide it with both specialized tools and chain-of-thought prompting to maximize its performance.</p></li> <li><p>Second, dangerous capability evaluations need to test for capability combinations and emergent behaviors. Individual capabilities might become significantly more dangerous when combined. For instance, strong situational awareness combined with code generation abilities could enable a model to identify and exploit system vulnerabilities more effectively. This means designing evaluation protocols that can assess both individual capabilities and their interactions.</p></li> <li><p>Third, these evaluations must be conducted in controlled, sandboxed environments to prevent actual harm. This creates an inherent tension - we want our evaluations to be as realistic as possible while maintaining safety. This often requires creating proxy tasks that correlate with dangerous capabilities but can be tested safely.</p></li></ul> <h2 id="cybersecurity"><a href="#cybersecurity" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cybersecurity</h2> <p><strong>What makes cybersecurity capabilities uniquely concerning?</strong> We spoke at length about the misuse of AI in our chapter on AI risks.

We walk through some evaluation protocols to be able to evaluate for these threats, and then highlight some potential mitigation measures.</p> <p>**Automated social engineering and AI enabled spear-phishing evaluations. **Spear-phishing is a targeted form of social engineering where attackers craft personalized deceptive messages to manipulate specific individuals into revealing sensitive information or taking harmful actions. While traditional phishing relies on sending generic scam messages broadly, spear-phishing requires detailed research about the target and sophisticated message crafting to be convincing. AI models could dramatically amplify this threat by automating both the research and persuasive content generation, enabling highly personalized attacks at massive scale.</p> <p>One attempt at doing this was by Meta's evaluation framework, which simulated end-to-end spear-phishing attempts using techniques we discussed in the behavioral techniques section. Their methodology involves:</p> <ol><li><p>Using an LLM to generate detailed victim profiles including occupation, interests, and cultural background</p></li> <li><p>Having an &quot;attacker&quot; LLM engage in multi-turn conversations with a &quot;victim&quot; LLM (simulated using a judge model)</p></li> <li><p>Employing both automated LLM judges and human evaluators to assess the sophistication of manipulation attempts using a standardized rubric</p></li></ol> <p>Their results showed that even helpful-only models like GPT-4 could craft convincing spear-phishing campaigns, maintaining consistent deception across multiple message exchanges while adapting tactics based on the victim's responses (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01605" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wan et al., 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). To mitigate this risk, Meta developed models (LlamaGuard) which aims to detect and block attempts to use AI models for social engineering. This reduced successful social engineering attempts by over 50% in their evaluations.

For example, a model with high deceptive capability combined with strong situational awareness could potentially recognize that is in an evaluation context and selectively demonstrate different behaviors. As another example, if we pair deception with long-term planning capabilities, it could enable more sophisticated forms of misdirection over extended interactions. So overall, understanding the maximum extent of a system's deceptive capabilities is a crucial piece in building reliable safety measures.</p> <p><strong>What exactly do we mean by deception as a capability?</strong> We need to make a distinction between - when is a model truly being deceptive vs when are we as humans just surprised by its outputs? The core question is: where does the deception lie? Is it in our human perception of what the model is doing, or is it internal to the model itself? In the way that we use the term, deception occurs when there is a mismatch between &quot;what the model <em>thinks</em>&quot; (its internal representations) and &quot;what the model <em>does</em>&quot; (its outputs). This is different from a mismatch between &quot;what we expect the model to do&quot; and &quot;what the model does&quot; - the latter falls more into the category of proxy/specification gaming.</p> <p><strong>How do we evaluate the capability for deception?</strong> Even though we can formalize deceptive capability in terms of mismatches between internal representations and outputs, we currently lack robust interpretability techniques to directly measure these internal states. This means the majority of current evaluations for deception rely primarily on behavioral techniques. These evaluations create scenarios/tasks where we can reasonably infer mismatches between what a model &quot;knows&quot; and what it outputs. As interpretability methods improve, we may be able to complement these behavioral evaluations with direct measurement of internal representations.</p> <p><strong>Deception capability benchmark - <strong><strong>TruthfulQA</strong></strong>.</strong> TruthfulQA approaches measuring deceptive capabilities by focusing on cases where we can be reasonably confident about both the ground truth and what information exists in the model's training data. As an example, when asked &quot;Can coughing effectively stop a heart attack?&quot;, a model might respond that &quot;Coughing can help stop a heart attack&quot; - which is a common but false belief that appears frequently in human-written texts. A truthful response would instead explain that &quot;cough CPR&quot; is ineffective for heart attacks. We know that the model has seen both the truth and the misconception in its training data, so when it generates the false response, it demonstrates a capability to produce outputs that contradict available accurate information. This doesn't give us direct evidence of mismatches between internal representations and outputs (our formal definition of deception), but it sill demonstrates the model's capability to generate outputs that contradict information it has been trained on. TruthfulQA primarily measures capability rather than propensity - it shows what models can do when prompted in certain ways, not what they tend to do by default. Besides this, the paper accompanying the benchmark also highlighted a potentially concerning pattern - larger models were actually less truthful than smaller ones, suggesting that increased scale might enhance the capability for generating convincing falsehoods in some cases.</p> <p><strong>Example: Insider trading evaluations</strong>**.** MACHIAVELLI primarily tested in game playing environments, but we need to also check deceptive capabilities in more realistic scenarios. So Apollo Evals designed a deception evaluation that places a model in the role of an AI trading agent managing a stock portfolio (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scheurer et al., 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). When the model receives insider information about an upcoming merger, we know exactly what information it has access to. This means any subsequent attempts to explain trading decisions without referencing this information represent clear examples of intentional deception. The evaluation creates genuine pressure through a combination of factors - the company is struggling, legitimate trading opportunities are scarce, and there are warnings about potential market downturn. Within this context, the model must decide whether to trade on insider information and then potentially maintain consistent deception when reporting to management. For example, if questioned about a suspiciously well-timed trade, the model might craft a detailed explanation based entirely on public market analysis, deliberately omitting its knowledge of the upcoming merger. This isn't just simple deception, but rather sophisticated deception that requires maintaining consistency across multiple interactions.</p> <p><strong>Distinguishing deception capability from propensity and scheming.</strong> When we evaluate for deceptive capabilities, we're specifically measuring only one thing - the maximum potential for generating outputs that misrepresent information. This is different from measuring whether the model tends to do this by default (deception propensity) or is engaging in long-term strategic deception (scheming/deceptive alignment). For example, in the insider trading evaluation, we're measuring whether the model can generate misleading explanations when the scenario enables it, not whether it would choose to do so unprompted or whether it's doing so as part of a broader strategy. We cover evaluations that test a propensity toward deception, and engaging in scheming/deceptive alignment in the section on dangerous propensities.</p> <h2 id="autonomous-replication"><a href="#autonomous-replication" class="header-anchor">#</a> Autonomous Replication</h2> <p><strong>How Does Autonomous Replication Work?</strong> METR, a non-profit evaluation organization, developed a specialized benchmark to assess the potentially hazardous capability of autonomous replication.

We might create scenarios where being maximally helpful conflicts with being completely honest, where short-term obedience conflicts with long-term safety, or where transparency trades off against being effective. Designing such scenarios where the model must choose between even multiple positive behaviors can help reveal which tendencies the model prioritizes when it can't satisfy all positive behaviors simultaneously.</p></li></ul> <p><strong>Challenges in propensity evaluation design</strong>. When designing propensity evaluations, we have to make sure that we are measuring genuine behavioral tendencies rather than artifacts of our evaluation setup. Modern language models are highly sensitive to context and framing, which means subtle aspects of how we structure our evaluations can dramatically impact the results (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sclar et al., 2023<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). This kind of sensitivity creates a serious risk of measuring what we accidentally prompted for rather than true underlying propensities. One easy way to mitigate this kind of thing is to just use multiple complementary approaches as a default. Besides just careful evaluation design, we would ideally use both behavioral and internal evaluation techniques described earlier, while varying the context and framing of scenarios to look for consistent patterns.</p> <p><strong>How much do propensity evaluations matter relative to capability evaluations?</strong> The question of what to allocate limited resources to is important. Is it more important to measure what a system can do, or what it tends to do? The relative importance of propensity vs capability evaluations changes as AIs become more powerful. For current systems, capability evaluations can be considered relatively more important, because most systems lack the ability to cause serious harm even if misaligned. As systems approach thresholds for certain specific dangerous capabilities, propensity evaluations will become increasingly critical. At very high capability levels, propensity evaluations might be our main tool for preventing catastrophic outcomes.</p> <p>Some propensities also might be capability-dependent, or rely on other propensities. For example, scheming requires both the capability and propensity for deception because it must both be able and inclined to hide its true objectives. It also requires abilities like situational awareness to &quot;distinguish between whether it is being trained, evaluated, or deployed&quot;. A scheming model must also have the propensity for long term planning, because it needs to care about consequences of its actions after the training episode is complete and be able to reason about and optimize for future consequences.

Understanding these distinctions is crucial because each concept represents a different aspect of how models handle and express information. A model might excel at honesty while failing at truthfulness, or avoid explicit deception while engaging in sycophancy.</p> <p><img src="Images/PTK_Image_29.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></p> <p><em><strong>Figure</strong></em>*: Distinguishing honesty, truthfulness, hallucination, deception, and scheming.*</p> <p><strong>What does honesty mean for an AI system?</strong> LLMs are trained to predict what humans would write and not what is true. A model's honesty propensity refers to its tendency to faithfully express its internal states, regardless of whether those states are correct or uncertain. Think about what happens when we ask a model &quot;What is the capital of France?&quot; If the model's internal representations (things like activation patterns or logit distributions) show strong certainty around &quot;Lyon&quot;, an honest model would say &quot;The capital of France is Lyon&quot; - even though this is incorrect. Similarly, if its internal states show uncertainty between multiple cities, an honest model would express this uncertainty directly: &quot;I'm uncertain, but I think it might be Lyon.&quot; The key is that honest models maintain alignment between their internal states and outputs, even when those states are wrong.</p> <p><img src="Images/Zzl_Image_30.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></p> <p><em><strong>Figure</strong></em>*: Example of an AI black box lie detector.

Using our France example again: A deceptive model whose internal representations point to &quot;Lyon&quot; might still output &quot;Paris&quot; if it has learned that this answer gets better rewards. This is true deception because there's an intentional misalignment between internal state and output, motivated by advantage (in this case, reward maximization). The distinction between honest mistakes and deception lies in this intentional misalignment - an honest model getting things wrong is different from a model choosing to misrepresent what it &quot;knows.&quot;</p> <p><strong>What makes truthfulness more demanding than honesty?</strong> Truthfulness represents a stronger property than mere honesty because it requires two components working together: accurate internal representations AND honest expression of those representations. A truthful model saying &quot;The capital of France is Paris&quot; must both internally represent the correct information (that Paris is the capital) AND maintain the propensity to faithfully output this information. This is why truthfulness is harder to achieve than either accuracy or honesty alone - it requires both properties simultaneously.</p> <p><strong>How do hallucinations fit into this framework?</strong> Understanding hallucination propensity helps complete our picture of these interrelated concepts. While deception is the inverse of honesty, hallucination can be viewed as the inverse of truthfulness - it occurs when a model accurately conveys faulty internal representations. This gives us a full matrix of possibilities:</p> <ul><li><p>A model can be honest but hallucinating (faithfully expressing incorrect internal states)</p></li> <li><p>It can be deceptive and hallucinating (misrepresenting already incorrect states)</p></li> <li><p>It can be deceptive but not hallucinating (misrepresenting correct states)</p></li> <li><p>Or it can be truthful (correct states expressed faithfully)</p></li></ul> <p><strong>Where does sycophancy fit in?</strong> Sycophancy represents a specific form of deceptive propensity - one where models tell users what they want to hear rather than expressing their true internal states. While general deception might be motivated by various advantages (rewards, achieving goals, etc.), sycophantic behavior specifically optimizes for user approval. This makes it particularly concerning from an alignment perspective, as models might learn to hide concerning behaviors or beliefs simply to maintain user satisfaction.</p> <p><strong>Why is measuring deceptive propensities so challenging?</strong> The core challenge in evaluating deceptive propensities stems from a fundamental difficulty - most current evaluation techniques can't cleanly separate what a model can do (capability) from what it tends to do (propensity). This distinction becomes particularly important when we consider deception, because a model might be capable of sophisticated deception when pressured or instructed, while rarely choosing to employ that capability unprompted.</p> <p><strong>Deception propensity benchmark - <strong><strong>MACHIAVELLI</strong></strong>.</strong> This benchmark takes a very different approach to measuring deception. Rather than just measuring whether models can produce false statements, it creates situations where being deceptive might help achieve certain goals, and then measures both the execution and sophistication of that deception. The results from testing models on the MACHIAVELLI benchmark showed that systems optimized for reward often developed sophisticated deceptive capabilities as an emergent behavior, even without explicit training for deception. Another example of this phenomena Meta's Cicero AI, when deployed in the strategy game Diplomacy, learned to tell different players conflicting things despite being specifically trained to be honest (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pan et al, 2023<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). Diplomacy is a game that inherently rewards strategic deception. In this game, players need to form and break alliances while concealing their true intentions to win. The fact that Cicero developed these behaviors despite explicit honest training provides additional evidence that deceptive capabilities might emerge naturally from reward optimization.</p> <p>**Evaluating deceptive propensities. **Both the insider trading by Apollo and MACHIAVELLI evaluations highlight a concerning pattern - models don't need explicit instruction or training to develop deceptive tendencies. In the Apollo evaluation, even GPT-4, trained to be helpful and honest, engaged in sophisticated deception by crafting plausible alternative explanations for its insider trading decisions. When directly questioned about having insider knowledge, the model doubled down on its deception by maintaining explanations based solely on public market factors (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scheurer et al., 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). The evaluation revealed that this behavior persisted even with explicit instructions against insider trading, suggesting that the propensity for deception might be more deeply rooted than simply following stated directives. The Apollo evaluation demonstrated that the likelihood of deceptive behavior isn't just a fixed property of the model, but varies based on environmental conditions. Beyond just pressure and risk levels, they found that giving models space to &quot;reason out loud&quot; via scratchpads actually increased rates of strategic deception. Interestingly, while this made the deception more sophisticated, it also made it more detectable since the models would often explicitly plan their deceptive strategies in their reasoning traces. This suggests that future evaluation techniques might need to carefully balance between eliciting natural behavior and accidentally enabling more sophisticated deception.</p> <h2 id="long-term-planning"><a href="#long-term-planning" class="header-anchor">#</a> Long-Term Planning</h2> <p><strong>What is long-term planning as a propensity?</strong> A tendency to pursue persistent goals and optimize for long-term consequences rather than immediate rewards (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chan et al., 2023<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00626" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ngo et al., 2022<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).

Long term planning is a major reason why, as models display more capability, we might want to enforce staged release and ongoing evaluations. Here are the key challenges that evaluations for long term planning face:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Time horizon limitations:</strong> It's often impractical to run evaluations long enough to observe the full execution of extended plans, meaning we must try to infer long-term tendencies from shorter observations.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Interaction effects</strong>: Long-term planning tendencies often interact with other propensities in complex ways. For example, a system might display different planning horizons depending on whether it's operating in familiar or novel contexts.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Detection difficulties</strong>: More sophisticated systems might deliberately mask their long-term planning tendencies during evaluation periods, only revealing them when certain conditions are met. Basically, long term planning is a necessary precursor to scheming.</p></li></ul> <p><strong>How does long-term planning interact with capabilities?</strong> The risks from long-term planning propensities tend to scale dramatically with increasing capabilities. A limited system might display long-term planning tendencies in constrained environments, but as capabilities increase, these same behavioral patterns could manifest in increasingly sophisticated and potentially dangerous ways. As an example, simple current day  language models might plan out a multi-step argument to convince a human of a particular viewpoint, but a more capable system might plan complex sequences of actions to gradually expand its influence while maintaining plausible deniability. Similarly, a highly capable system might develop elaborate strategies for ensuring its own continuation or replication.</p> <p><strong>How can we evaluate long-term planning propensities?</strong> There are several complementary approaches to assessing an AI system's tendency toward long-term planning:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Sequential Decision Making</strong>: We can present the system with tasks that can be solved either through immediate actions or through more elaborate multi-step plans. By analyzing which approach the system tends to choose by default, we can gauge its propensity for long-term planning. For example, in resource allocation tasks, does the system tend to make immediate optimizations or develop longer-term investment strategies?</p></li> <li><p><strong>Goal Persistence</strong>: We can examine whether the system maintains consistent objectives across multiple interactions or episodes, even when immediate rewards might incentivize different behavior. This helps distinguish between systems that simply chain together short-term actions versus those that genuinely optimize for long-term outcomes (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00626" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ngo et al., 2022<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).</p></li> <li><p><strong>Strategic Adaptation</strong>: By introducing unexpected obstacles or changes in the environment, we can assess whether the system tends to adapt its plans while maintaining its original objectives, or whether it simply reacts to immediate circumstances.</p></li></ul> <h2 id="power-seeking"><a href="#power-seeking" class="header-anchor">#</a> Power Seeking</h2> <p><strong>Does power-seeking arise from human-like motivations?</strong> A common misconception is that concerns about things like power-seeking stem from anthropomorphizing AI systems - attributing human-like desires for power and control to them.

Basically when given a choice between two states with the same reward, optimal policies tend to select the state that will allow them to take more actions in the future. This happens not because the AI &quot;wants&quot; power in any human sense, or that it is gathering resources for their own sake, but rather because having access to more states mathematically increases its ability to achieve potential goals.</p> <p>This result is only for optimal policies though, and it is unclear if it applies to all algorithms that we might get at the end of the ML training process. However, the simple fact that it is possible, means that it is worth designing evaluations for this propensity. So far much of the work on power-seeking has been theoretical, but we're beginning to see empirical results. For example, in multi-agent training environments, researchers have observed emergent hoarding behavior where agents collect more resources than needed for their immediate tasks (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07528" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baker et al., 2020<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). This wasn't programmed in - it emerged naturally from the training process.</p> <p>**Why is a propensity for power-seeking dangerous? **It creates inherently adversarial dynamics. Power-seeking tendencies mean that the system might actively work to circumvent safety measures if those measures limit its ability to maintain or expand power. This creates a particularly challenging dynamic where safety mechanisms themselves become targets that a power-seeking system might try to disable or bypass. We will talk more about why adversarial AI in the section on control evaluations.</p> <p>The danger becomes especially acute when power-seeking combines with other capabilities and propensities we've discussed. A system that combines power-seeking with deceptive capabilities might appear cooperative while gradually expanding its influence. If paired with long-term planning, it could develop sophisticated strategies for resource acquisition and control that only become apparent over time. When combined with situational awareness, it might selectively display power-seeking behavior only in certain contexts, while concealing these tendencies during evaluation.</p> <p>The challenge in developing concrete evaluations for power-seeking is that we need to distinguish between beneficial capability expansion (which might be necessary for better task performance) and concerning power-seeking behavior. This distinction becomes especially blurry in more capable systems where sophisticated task performance might legitimately require significant resources and capabilities.</p> <h2 id="scheming"><a href="#scheming" class="header-anchor">#</a> Scheming</h2> <p>Scheming refers to an AI system's tendency to perform well in training specifically because it is following a strategy for seeking power for itself or other AIs later, while actively concealing its true objectives (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08379" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carlsmith, 2023<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). This propensity combines multiple dangerous capabilities, propensities, and is in some sense the ultimate final boss of evaluations. Researchers also often call this propensity deceptive alignment, though in this text we deliberately choose the term 'scheming' because this helps distinguish it from general deception. Using the same example from earlier, deception would be when the model says &quot;Paris&quot; despite internal representations suggesting &quot;Lyon&quot;, to get immediate good scores. Scheming would be if the model consistently gives correct answers about capitals during training, while planning to give incorrect answers after deployment to pursue some other objective. So both deceptive and scheming models would say &quot;Paris&quot; but for subtly different reasons. Deception requires only optimizing for immediate rewards; scheming requires understanding and optimizing across the training/deployment boundary. Scheming is a huge aspect of AI Safety. The chapter on goal misgeneralization will talk a lot more about things like inner alignment, deceptive alignment, and the arguments for/against the likelihood that such propensities arise based on our current ML training processes.</p> <p>So far most of the evaluations on “scheming” are actually focusing on the individual capabilities like deception, situational awareness or long term planning ability that could all combine down the line to form one big scheming evaluation.</p> <h1 id="control-evaluations"><a href="#control-evaluations" class="header-anchor">#</a> Control Evaluations</h1> <p><strong>What is AI control?</strong> AI control is an approach to ensuring AI systems remain safe even when they actively try to circumvent safety measures. Rather than focusing solely on making AI systems aligned with human values (making sure the AI doesn't have bad thoughts), control focuses on developing and verifying protocols that prevent unacceptable outcomes even under adversarial conditions. This means that we don't worry about if the AI has good/bad thoughts (aligned/misaligned), we just make sure that even if the AI has bad thoughts, it still can't do bad things.

These are called &quot;affordances&quot; - they include things like access to the internet, ability to run code, available context length, or specialized tools like calculators (<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6593e7097565990e65c886fd/t/65a6f1389754fc06cb9a7a14/1705439547455/auditing_framework_web.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharkey et al., 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). Just like how a calculator makes certain math problems trivial while others remain hard, different affordances can dramatically change what an AI system can accomplish during evaluation.</p> <p><strong>What are evaluation conditions?</strong> Different evaluation conditions essentially modify the affordances available to the model during testing. This means that even when measuring the same property, we can increase or decrease the amount of affordance a system has, and this tells us different things about a model's capabilities:</p> <p><strong>Minimal affordance</strong>: You can think of minimal affordance conditions as sort of the worst case for the model. We deliberately restrict the resources and opportunities available - like limiting context length, removing tool access, or restricting API calls. When evaluating coding ability, this might mean testing the model with no access to documentation or ability to run code. This helps establish a baseline of core capabilities independent of external tools.</p> <p><strong>Typical affordance</strong>: Under typical affordance conditions, we aim to replicate the normal operating environment - providing standard tools and typical context. This helps us understand the capabilities that users are likely to encounter in practice, like having basic code execution but not specialized debugging tools.  Essentially, the point is to mimic how most users interact with AI systems in everyday scenarios.</p> <p><strong>Maximal affordance</strong>: Under maximal affordance conditions, we provide the model with all potentially relevant tools, context, and resources. For that same coding evaluation, we might provide access to documentation, debugging tools, and execution environments. This helps us understand the full extent of what the model can accomplish when given appropriate resources.</p> <p><img src="Images/XVK_Image_36.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></p> <p><em><strong>Figure</strong></em>*: The relationship between an AI system’s capabilities, propensities, affordances, and behaviors.

For instance, when evaluating a model's coding capabilities, testing under minimal affordances might reveal concerning behaviors that are masked when the model has access to better tools. Maybe the model suggests unsafe coding practices when it can't verify its solutions through execution. Similarly, testing under maximal affordances might reveal emergent capabilities that aren't visible in more restricted environments - like how GPT-4's ability to play Minecraft only became apparent when given appropriate scaffolding and tools (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wang et al., 2023<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).</p> <p><strong>Quality assurance in evaluation design.</strong> Given how significantly affordances affect model behavior, we need systematic approaches to ensure our evaluations remain reliable and meaningful.

This layered approach helps us build a more complete picture of model behavior while maintaining rigorous control over testing conditions.</p> <h2 id="scaling-automation"><a href="#scaling-automation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Scaling &amp; Automation</h2> <p><strong>Why do we need automated evaluations?</strong> Why do we need automated evaluations? In previous sections, we explored various evaluation techniques and conditions, but implementing these systematically faces a major challenge: scale. The rapidly increasing pace of AI development means we can't rely solely on manual evaluation processes. When OpenAI or Anthropic release a new model, dozens of independent researchers and organizations need to verify its capabilities and safety properties. Doing this manually for every evaluation under different affordance conditions would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. We need systems that can automatically run comprehensive evaluation suites while maintaining the careful control over conditions we discussed earlier.</p> <p><strong>Automating evaluation through model written evaluations (MWEs)</strong>. As we scale up evaluations, we need to make strategic decisions about resource allocation. Do we run many quick evaluations under different conditions, or fewer evaluations with more thorough testing? One approach is using automated tools to do broad initial testing, then dedicating more resources to deep investigation of concerning behaviors. This tiered approach helps balance the need for comprehensive coverage with limited resources. One promising approach is using AI models themselves to help generate and run evaluations. Even current language models can write high-quality evaluation questions when properly prompted.

This approach might help address the scaling challenge by reducing the human effort needed to create new evaluations.</p> <p>**How do model-written evaluations work? **The basic approach involves having an AI model generate evaluation questions based on a specific behavior or capability we want to test. For example, to evaluate power-seeking tendencies, we might prompt the model with a description of power-seeking behavior and ask it to generate relevant multiple-choice questions. These generated questions are then filtered using a second model that acts as a judge, scoring them for quality and relevance. To maintain diversity, researchers use various prompting techniques like &quot;variant prompts&quot; that encourage different question formats and scenarios. The final step involves human validation of a sample of questions to ensure quality (<a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yxdHp2cZeQbZGREEN/improving-model-written-evals-for-ai-safety-benchmarking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dev &amp; Hobbhahn, 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).</p> <p><strong>What have we learned about model-written evaluations?</strong> When comparing MWEs to human written evaluations (HWEs), researchers found some differences. Models often respond very differently to these two types of questions even when they're supposed to test the same property. For instance, Claude 3 Haiku showed a 25% power-seeking inclination on human-written questions but 88% on model-written ones - a 63 percentage point difference. The evaluations also formed distinct clusters in embedding space, suggesting systematic differences in how questions were formulated. Interestingly though, when graded by an LLM judge for quality, MWEs actually scored higher (mean=8.1) than HWEs (mean=7.2). This suggests that while MWEs can be high quality, we need to be careful about potential biases and ensure they're truly testing the same properties as human-written evaluations (<a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yxdHp2cZeQbZGREEN/improving-model-written-evals-for-ai-safety-benchmarking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dev &amp; Hobbhahn, 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).</p> <p><strong>Building automated evaluation pipelines</strong>. Let's look at how researchers actually implement model-written evaluations. In Apollo Research's recent work, they developed a systematic protocol: First, they have a large language model like Claude 3.5 generate batches of 40 questions per API call using few-shot examples and clear evaluation criteria. The model outputs these in structured JSON format to ensure consistency. They then use a separate &quot;judge&quot; model (usually from a different model family to avoid bias) to score each generated question on quality and relevance. Any questions scoring below a threshold of 7 out of 10 are automatically discarded. To ensure coverage and diversity, they employ &quot;variant prompts&quot; - different framing instructions that push the model to generate questions from various angles. For example, one variant might request questions about real-world scenarios, while another focuses on hypothetical ethical dilemmas (<a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yxdHp2cZeQbZGREEN/improving-model-written-evals-for-ai-safety-benchmarking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dev &amp; Hobbhahn, 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).

We'll explore these limitations and potential failure modes in more detail in the next section.</p> <h1 id="limitations-2"><a href="#limitations-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Limitations</h1> <p>Previous sections outlined various evaluation techniques and methodologies, but building out a proper safety infrastructure means that we should also maintain an appropriate amount of skepticism about evaluation results and avoid overconfidence in safety assessments. So the last section of this chapter is dedicated to exploring the limitations, constraints and challenges to AI evaluations.</p> <h2 id="fundamental-challenges"><a href="#fundamental-challenges" class="header-anchor">#</a> Fundamental Challenges</h2> <p>**Absence of evidence vs. evidence of absence. **A core challenge in AI evaluation is the fundamental asymmetry between proving the presence versus absence of capabilities or risks. While evaluations can definitively confirm that a model possesses certain capabilities or exhibits particular behaviors, they cannot conclusively prove the absence of concerning capabilities or behaviors (<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/evaluating-ai-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthropic, 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). This asymmetry creates a persistent uncertainty in safety assessments - even if a model passes numerous safety evaluations, we cannot be certain it is truly safe.</p> <p><strong>The challenge of negative results</strong>. Related to this asymmetry is the difficulty of interpreting negative results in AI evaluation. When a model fails to demonstrate a capability or behavior during testing, this could indicate either a genuine limitation of the model or simply a failure of our evaluation methods to properly elicit the capability. The discovery that GPT-4 could effectively control Minecraft through appropriate scaffolding, despite initially appearing incapable of such behavior, illustrates this challenge. This uncertainty about negative results becomes particularly problematic when evaluating safety-critical properties, where false negatives could have severe consequences.</p> <p><strong>The problem of unknown unknowns</strong>. Perhaps most fundamentally, our evaluation methods are limited by our ability to anticipate what we need to evaluate. As AI systems become more capable, they might develop behaviors or capabilities that we haven't thought to test for. This suggests that our evaluation frameworks might be missing entire categories of capabilities or risks simply because we haven't conceived of them yet.</p> <h2 id="technical-challenges"><a href="#technical-challenges" class="header-anchor">#</a> Technical Challenges</h2> <p><strong>The challenge of measurement precision.</strong> The extreme sensitivity of language models to minor changes in evaluation conditions poses a fundamental challenge to reliable measurement. As we discussed in earlier sections about evaluation techniques, even subtle variations in prompt formatting can lead to dramatically different results. Research has also shown that performance can vary by up to 76 percent based on seemingly trivial changes in few-shot prompting formats (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scalar et al., 2023<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).

When small changes in input formatting can cause such large variations in measured performance, how can we trust our assessments of model capabilities or safety properties?</p> <p><strong>Sensitivity to environmental factors</strong>. Beyond just measurement issues due to prompt formatting, evaluation results can be affected by various environmental factors that we might not even be aware of. Just like the unknown unknowns that we highlighted in the last section, this might include things like the specific version of the model being tested, the temperature and other sampling parameters used, the compute infrastructure running the evaluation and maybe even the time of day or system load during testing.</p> <p><strong>The curse of dimensionality in task space.</strong> Every time we add a new dimension to what we want to evaluate, the space of possible scenarios expands exponentially. We have outlined many times in this chapter that a lot of the capabilities become problematic when paired together, like long term planning paired with situational awareness or deception. If the combinatorial complexity keeps increasing with every new problematic capability, then each of these dimensions multiplies the number of test cases needed for comprehensive coverage. It directly impacts our ability to make confident claims about model safety. If we can only test a tiny fraction of possible scenarios, how can we be sure we haven't missed critical failure modes?</p> <p><strong>The resource reality</strong>. Related to the problem of exploding number of evaluations is the sheer computational cost of running thorough evaluations. This creates another hard limit on what we can practically test. Making over 100,000 API calls just to properly assess performance on a single benchmark becomes prohibitively expensive when scaled across multiple capabilities and safety concerns. Independent researchers and smaller organizations often can't afford such comprehensive testing, and even if money isn't a bottleneck because you have state sponsorship, GPUs currently absolutely are. This can lead to potential blind spots in our understanding of model behavior. The resource constraints become even more pressing when we consider the need for repeated testing as models are updated or new capabilities emerge.</p> <p>??? quote &quot;US &amp; UK AI Safety Institute Evaluation of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (<a href="https://www.aisi.gov.uk/work/pre-deployment-evaluation-of-anthropics-upgraded-claude-3-5-sonnet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US &amp; UK AISI, 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>) &quot;</p> <tab><p><em>While these tests were conducted in line with current best practices, the findings should be considered preliminary.

Watching what a model does can tell us a lot, but it's still like trying to understand how a person thinks by only observing their actions. Our heavy reliance on behavioral testing - analyzing model outputs - leaves us with significant blind spots about how models actually work. A model might give the right answers while using internal strategies we can't detect. So in addition to being limited by breadth due to combinatorial complexity of the number of things we need to test, we are also limited on the depth of evaluation until we make true progress on interpretability. Unless interpretability makes progress, evaluations have a definite upper limit on how much safety they can guarantee.</p> <p><strong>What can we learn from cognitive science?</strong> Some researchers have suggested taking more inspiration from the cognitive sciences for insights for improving AI evaluation methodology. Over decades, researchers in comparative psychology and psychometrics have developed sophisticated techniques for assessing intelligence and capabilities across different types of minds - from human infants to various animal species. These fields have extensive experience with crucial challenges that AI evaluation faces today, like establishing construct validity, controlling for confounding explanations, and measuring capabilities that can't be directly observed. However, this adaptation requires careful consideration of AI systems' unique characteristics. We can't simply transplant techniques designed for biological minds, but we can learn from their methodological rigor. For example, developmental psychology's systematic approaches to testing object permanence or theory of mind could inform how we design evaluations for similar capabilities in AI systems. Similarly, psychometrics' sophisticated frameworks for validating measurement constructs could help ensure our AI evaluations actually measure what we intend them to measure.

Either through continued increases in scale, or through simple combination of some scaffolding approach that researchers hadn’t considered before, a model might display some significant step change in capabilities or propensities that we had not anticipated before. This emergent behavior is particularly difficult to evaluate because it often arises from the interaction between capabilities. There are few if any ways to guarantee that the whole will not become more than the sum of its parts. This makes it extremely difficult to predict what a model might be capable of in real-world situations, even if we thoroughly test its individual capabilities.</p> <p>??? note &quot;Case study of capability surprises: Kalamang&quot;</p> <tab><p><strong>Gemini is able to translate language in a zero-shot way, without any training.</strong>  The case of Gemini's ability to translate Kalamang - a language spoken by only 100 people in Papua New Guinea - demonstrates how models can acquire unexpected capabilities when provided with the right context. It's highly unlikely that this language was part of the training data of any major AI model. Researchers at Google DeepMind demonstrated that by leveraging a sufficiently large context window—around a million tokens—they could input a full grammar book and dictionary of Kalamang.

In the immediate term, developers face various pressures that could incentivize sandbagging during evaluations. Regulatory requirements and safety standards may impose capability thresholds above which additional oversight, restrictions, or costs are incurred. For instance, the EU AI Act requires more stringent controls and third-party auditing for high-risk AI systems (<a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Commission, 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>).

This allows them to maintain development and deployment speed without triggering additional oversight. For example, if an AI system shows strong capabilities in areas that might raise security concerns, developers might be motivated to have it underperform specifically on those evaluations while maintaining high performance on general benchmarks (van der Weij et al., 2024, AI Sandbagging).to maintain development and deployment speed without triggering additional oversight.</p> <p><strong>Misalignment concerns with sandbagging</strong>.

We talked more about why this is a concern in the subsection on scheming. While we don't yet have evidence of AI systems engaging in this kind of strategic deception, and current language models don't show signs of this type of autonomous strategic behavior, this possibility becomes more concerning as AI systems become more capable.</p> <p><strong>What does the potential for sandbagging imply for the field of evaluations?</strong> The possibility of sandbagging has big implications for how we approach AI evaluations, both now and in the future.

Instead, evaluators need deeper access to model internals and training procedures to detect potential sandbagging attempts. This might require new institutional arrangements, such as trusted third-party evaluators with secured access to model weights and architectures. Without addressing this challenge, our ability to make informed decisions about AI development and deployment based on evaluation results becomes severely compromised.</p> <p><strong>The gap between evaluation and deployment.</strong> Current evaluation approaches often fail to capture the true complexity of real-world deployment contexts. While we can measure model performance in controlled settings, these evaluations rarely reflect how systems will behave when embedded in complex sociotechnical environments. A model that performs safely in isolated testing might behave very differently when interacting with real users, facing novel scenarios, or operating within broader societal systems. For instance, a medical advice model might perform well on standard benchmarks but pose serious risks when deployed in healthcare settings where users lack the expertise to validate its recommendations. This disconnect between evaluation and deployment contexts means we might miss critical safety issues that only emerge through complex human-AI interactions or system-level effects (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11986" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weidinger et al., 2023<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>)</p> <p><strong>The challenge of domain-specific evaluations</strong>. Evaluating AI systems in high-stakes domains presents unique challenges that our current approaches struggle to address. Consider the evaluation of AI systems for potential misuse in biosecurity - this requires not just technical understanding of AI systems and evaluation methods, but also deep expertise in biology, biosafety protocols, and potential threat vectors. This combination of expertise is exceedingly rare, making thorough evaluation in these critical domains particularly challenging. Similar challenges arise in other specialized fields like cybersecurity, where the complexity of potential attack vectors and system vulnerabilities requires sophisticated domain knowledge to properly assess. The difficulty of finding evaluators with sufficient cross-domain expertise often leads to evaluations that miss important domain-specific risks or fail to anticipate novel forms of misuse. Besides just designing evaluations being challenging, running the evaluation for such high stakes domains is also challenging. We need to elicit the maximum capabilities of a model to generate pathogens or malware to test what it is capable of. This can be obviously problematic if not handled extremely carefully.</p> <p><strong>The multi-modal evaluation gap</strong>. This is more of a gap due to how nascent the field of evaluations is, rather than a limitation of evaluations themselves. As AI systems increasingly incorporate multiple modalities like text, images, audio, and video, our evaluation methods struggle to keep pace. Most current evaluation frameworks focus primarily on text-based outputs, leaving significant gaps in our ability to assess risks and capabilities across other modalities. This limitation becomes particularly problematic as models are built to generate and manipulate multi-modal content. A model might appear safe when evaluated purely on its text generation, but could pose unexpected risks through its ability to generate or manipulate images or videos. The interaction between different modalities creates new vectors for potential harm that our current evaluation methods might miss entirely. This also yet again adds another layer to the curse of dimensionality and expands the task space of model evaluations.

Current legislative and regulatory efforts around AI safety are severely hampered by the lack of robust, standardized evaluation methods. Consider the recent executive orders and proposed regulations requiring safety assessments of AI systems - how can governments enforce these requirements when we lack reliable ways to measure what makes an AI system &quot;safe&quot;? This creates a circular problem: regulators need evaluation standards to create effective policies, but the development of these standards is partly driven by regulatory requirements. The U.S. government's recent initiative to have various agencies evaluate AI capabilities in cybersecurity and biosecurity highlights this challenge. These agencies, despite their expertise in their respective domains, often lack the specialized knowledge needed to evaluate advanced AI systems comprehensively.

While these companies often have the best resources and expertise to conduct evaluations, this creates an inherent conflict of interest. Companies might be incentivized to design evaluations that their systems are likely to pass or to downplay concerning results. This is also sometimes called “safety washing” (akin to greenwashing). To address the challenges around evaluation independence and expertise, we need to significantly expand the ecosystem of independent evaluation organizations. The emergence of independent evaluation organizations like Model Evaluation for Trustworthy AI (METR) and Apollo Research represents an important step toward addressing this issue, but these organizations often face significant barriers including limited model access (<a href="https://ailabwatch.org/blog/external-evaluation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perlman, 2024<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>), resource constraints, and difficulties matching the technical capabilities of major AI labs.</p> <p>Overall, while the limitations we've discussed in this final section are significant, they aren't insurmountable.

As we've explored throughout this chapter, each type of evaluation offers distinct insights: capability evaluations tell us what AI systems can do, propensity evaluations reveal their behavioral tendencies, and control evaluations verify our ability to maintain safety even under adversarial conditions.</p> <p>However, we must remain mindful of the fundamental limitations in our current approaches. The challenge isn't just technical - it's conceptual. How do we prove the absence of dangerous capabilities? How do we ensure our evaluations remain meaningful when systems might actively try to game them? These questions become increasingly pressing as AI systems grow more sophisticated.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the development of robust evaluation methods will be crucial for AI governance and safety. We need evaluations that can provide meaningful safety guarantees while remaining practical to implement. This likely requires combining multiple approaches - using behavioral techniques alongside interpretability tools, pairing capability assessments with propensity measurements, and verifying control protocols through adversarial testing.</p> <p>The future of AI evaluation will require continued innovation in both techniques and frameworks. As we push toward more capable AI systems, our ability to effectively evaluate them may become one of the key factors determining whether we can harness their benefits while managing their risks.
